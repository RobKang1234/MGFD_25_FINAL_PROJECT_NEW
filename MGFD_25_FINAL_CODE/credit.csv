**Try to include as many of the following details as possible:**

- All accounts, cards, loans, mortgages, etc - the bad *and* the good. (Include their name as this is helpful for knowing previous strategies to deal with them.)

- Credit Limits

- Balances (Round this number - it will keep you anonymous)

- Last payment date

- Date of last delinquency (this will determine when it falls off your report)

- Date opened

- Payment status (pays as agreed, sold to collections, etc)

- Estimation of # of lates (30, 60, 90, 120+)

1,UPDATE: Getting weekly FULL credit reports has been extended through rest of 2022 at AnnualCreditReport.com,103,sih7qn,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/sih7qn/update_getting_weekly_full_credit_reports_has/,12,"## Here is the update:

## ""January 24, 2022

**Free Credit Report Offering Extended:** **TransUnion is pleased to offer you free weekly credit reports throughout 2022. This consumer benefit will continue to help people across the country manage their financial health during the ongoing hardship and economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19.""**

It is definitely worth getting your reports at least once a month during this period. If you are paying for various services, you may want to suspend that to save some money. Unfortunately this does NOT INCLUDE the key credit scores. Those are still for pay only at the usual sites or you can obtain basic FICO / Vantage scores for free at the sites listed in the sidebar.

There are several pieces of KEY INFORMATION on your official reports that are not readily available on most the typical free credit reporting sites. Notable your DOFD (date of first delinquency) and the calculated date when a negative item should be removed from your report.

2,Confused on credit card use.,2,tvd6a1,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tvd6a1/confused_on_credit_card_use/,5,"I’m trying to keep my CC use under 30% but am new to credit anything. I ruined my credit when I was 18 years old (cliche, I know) and got it down to 480. I’m currently at 610 (vantage score) but still have no idea what I’m doing. 

If the credit limit is for example $600, could I use $500 on an emergency and pay it off before the actual due date that the minimum payment is due and still be considered under 30%? 

My CC use is currently at 25% and I’ve kept it at that or below for months but am in a situation where I actually need to use it and almost max it out. Would I be able to do that, pay it off within two weeks and it not be reported? Or would that still lower my credit score solely on the fact that I used it past 30%? 

I thought maybe this was a dumb question but I literally have no idea. Hopefully this makes sense and you’re all able to give me some insight.

Anyway, the plan I'm brewing is to split my day-to-day purchases between the two, maximizing my rewards on both. The problem is in the way I pay. I pay off everything every two weeks on payday, which means I'm always going to post something of a balance due to varying times between payment and statement close.

As in the title, I know AZEO is how to maximize the utilization portion of your score, but if I keep two of three cards at <10%, how much will that hurt me?

I have started looking at places in the areas I am considering but I probably wouldn't actually start looking till summertime. 

&#x200B;

I know getting new personal credit cards is not a good thing when planning to get a home loan.  My most recent personal cards were 2 cards in September of 2021 (I thought the spark select wouldn't have been personal as it's marked as a business card).  I have gotten an Amex business card more recently but as its a business card that does not affect my personal credit (other than Amex's initial first inquiry and if I don't make payments etc) I am under the assumption that my business card and acquisition of any new business cards (with Amex since they don't hp for more cards) would not affect a home loan that I would be looking to get.  Other than the credit cards I have no and had no lines of credit (like a car, school, etc payment).

My AAoA is 5 years, my total credit limit is around 33K and my utilization would be under 10% or 15% when I'd start looking for a loan (I'm currently at 17%).

I know this not the full rundown of what's needed, but I thought it would be a good starting point to give me some ideas.  Any thoughts or opinions are welcome as I am trying to get a better understanding and how to move forward that best fits my situation.

Could I actually get approved for a downpayment of around 3-5% on a 200,000 house?

due to my new personal cards in September 2021, how long should I wait till I start talking to lenders about a loan?

are my assumptions right that if I did acquire another Amex business card it would not affect my home loan?

random question, with a conventional loan if I am approved for say 215,000 and the home costs 200,000 could I use the extra 15K for improvements? or would I need to be using a FHA 203K loan?",1649003494

Also, I'm 28, in case you see the school loan listed below and think I'm young and dumb.. nope.. I'm just dumb.

Anyway, here are the details on my credit in the hopes that someone can provide options that might work for me.

&#x200B;

**Credit Score:** 647 Vantage (would be higher if I paid off my credit cards) 70% utilization but I have a low limit anyway. I could pay them off with a paycheck or two and raise my credit.

**Credit Building:** I've had 2 credit cards for three years. A mortgage for the last 6 months, and a very small and feasible school loan that is still deferred until May from covid (dropped out).

**Payment History:** 100% paid on time for all loans and credit cards. 0 missed payments

**Collections:** 1 derogatory medical bill

**Hard Inquiries:** Roughly 10 from last year while home buying

**Average Credit History:**  little low due to the recent mortgage (I think 2 years?)

**Income:** Make around 54k a year with employment history in good standing

**Debt to Income Ratio:** 18% ($3,600 monthly gross after bills are paid)

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the past week - I went to the credit union to pay the outstanding balance (request of underwriting for mortgage application), and they told me that they have no record of that account. 

How can the bureaus report the account as verified but the credit union has no record? My guess is that the bureaus ""verified"" with the secondary sources instead of with the credit union? Regardless, how can either pay the balance or have the account removed?

I Have a Capital One quicksilver secured card, with 400$ limit, and trying to keep the balance between 10% and 30%. my score got to 650 last month, it was looking good for me.

Then I decided due to personal reasons with time and such, I wanted a dishwasher to make things easier. OK Lowe's had some deal last month were you'd get something like 150$ off with opening a Lowe's advantage card, and no interest if i paid it off within a year. It was 900$ which I can easily do within the year.

Well stupid me misunderstood and i thought the way it'd work is it'd charge 1/12 of the price (it said  83$ a month) to the card, and as long as i paid it every month there'd be no interest, and with a 1000$ credit limit,  83$ is well within the 10-20% balance range, however i noticed the other day i got a charge for 120$. Ok, a bit more than i thought but still fine, it mentioned debt security thing if i lose my job or something, sure. But then it adds another 800$ charge to the card, which was not what i was expecting. So now i have a balance around 950$, and because of the high balance my credit score dropped 50 points and i have poor credit now.so basically is this repairable? like how hard will it be to get back to fair credit (650 range)?  or have i permanently screwed things up?

TLDR;Opened a 1000$ Lowe's advantage card for a dishwasher and misunderstood how it worked, so instead of 85$ charges every month, received the full 950$ charge so balance is 950$ and credit score dropped 50 points, not sure what to do.

I just found out my grandmother (83, but healthy and active enough to live well past 100) has been going through multiple for-profit credit counseling programs. The latest one just closed her account, but for some reason didn't pay off one of her debts.

She had a Walmart card with around $4000 on it. It was sold off to collections a long time ago. For whatever reason, this collections agency would not work with the credit counseling programs.

She has not paid or even heard from them in 3.5 years.

Her current credit score is 630. She would like to have a good credit score 'just in case' but has plenty of kids to take care of her if she ever needs to get anything.

Should she pay this debt off, or let it sit? She is getting different suggestions from different people.

I have no loans (student/auto/mortgage/private) and I have one credit card with Discover (secured with a $200 limit) which I have paid on time for about 2 years straight. 

The info on my Credit Karma says I have 100% payment history, 0 derogatory marks and 25% credit utilization yet my score is 579 on Transunion and 623 on Equifax. 

I honestly don’t know what else to do. Discover will not graduate me from secured to unsecured and I have called them so many times about this asking them why. They never have a response to it. 

I’m hesitant to apply for another credit card because I have 6 hard inquiries mostly from 2020 when I was looking for a new credit card.

What else can I do to get my credit up??

My husband and I have been working on our credit score for about two years. We have made significant progress, especially since both of us had made some pretty bad financial decisions. I was almost at 700 and he was at 650. 

Well, a few months ago we had no choice but to buy another car because we both needed to commute for work. We don’t have very good public transit and since we worked the same schedule in opposite directions, we had  to do it. At the time, we didn’t have enough savings to buy a car in cash so we financed one - this was in August. We barely made the cut and we’re approved after the dealership went to a small local lender. 

It looks like the company finally reported our car loan this month (March). My credit score dropped 25 points, but my husband’s dropped 50. This sucks because he’s a veteran and we were so close to getting his credit score to 660, which we need to get a better interest rate on a VA loan to buy a house. We have been working with a mortgage lender and doing so much to repair our credit, even when we both lost our jobs when the pandemic started and I was ineligible to collect unemployment. 

Is there anything we can do to make this go away quickly? We still have a little bit of debt to pay off, but fortunately we both found jobs with substantial pay increases a few months ago. Trying to look on the bright side, but it really bums me out - especially that my husband’s score tanked like that. 

So lame! Any advice on this? We make all of our payments on time and we have good scores on everything except debt to income ratio.

Hi, I am new to this community, forgive me if this not the place to ask...

I refinanced my mortgage a couple months ago and on my Credit Karma (VantageScore 3.0) I am seeing 3 hard inquiries listed. 

Of note, I explored in depth with my mortgage holder at the time, i.e, I signed some documents but backed out before the apprasial. I submitted financial documents with another option but never signed anything and did not move forward. I ended up refinancing with a third option.

Equifax shows hard inquiries on 1.14 company X and Y and also Y again on 1.26. Trans Union shows X  and Z and again Z, for the same dates respectively.

I was of the understanding that multiple hard inquiries over a given time in reach of this type of loan results in ""one hard inquiry"". This was all less than two weeks time. Why am I seeing 3 hard inquiries? 

Since I'm here, why do three different lenders show up on two different reports, especially since I (I believe) i had my credit pulled by two lenders? The dates are the same, I would assume the lenders would be the same.

I've had 3 bank credit cards (down to 2 now, total balance limit is like $2,800, the other card was closed through the bank), and 1 car payment. That's all that I have in terms of credit anything. 

Once I pay off the car, I'll be down to 2 credit cards. Is that enough to have a ""healthy"" or good credit file?

Things like that... all of those were like before 2018. Not sure if it matters). 

Should I hold off on paying off my car payment? I have 5k left on the loan, with a monthly payment of $416.. but I've been paying a couple thousands extra each month. I planned on getting it fully paid off by June but if only having 2 bank credit cards open is bad/looks bad for future lenders, I'm not sure what else I can do... except maybe just do a monthly $500 payment towards the loan, instead of what I've been doing. 

Only things I'd need a loan for is a house... or a car payment (but in the future, I'd rather pay it in full the day of than do another loan). 

Will future lenders be like ""yes. This person pays their stuff on time/early. Their two open cards hold a zero balance or less than 5% balance every month. This is a great person to lend to"".... or will they be like ""this person only has 2 credit lines, they pay on time/early so we probably wont get a profit off them, I'm gonna deny a loan""...?

I'm obviously not planning on going out and opening new lines of credit or anything like that. But in the future, how bad is it to only have 2 lines of credit?

These cards are now charged off 4 total, 2 of which have collections i can work with. Should I settle all 4 for 1/2 of original balance? Let them all ride till they fall off  my credit report? 

Here's my thinking to start to rebuild my credit: 1) settle the accounts that I can. 2) get a secured card or 2 and make small monthly purchases pay off balances (I know this now) and regularly add to the secured deposit to reflect credit limit increase. 3) the accounts i can't settle just let them ride and have them fall off.

A main reason was this hospital bill that sent me to collections- but my parents are adamant that our insurance covered the bill and the hospital is messing something up.

When I first googled I came across this
    
1. Start sending disputes to all 3 credit reporting agencies. Every 45 days mail a new dispute based on some perceived error on your collection reports: dates, amounts, etc... If the collection agencies fails to respond to the CRA within 30 days it will be removed. The hope is that the CA has no financial incentive to respond. They have other fish to fry and completing the paperwork to respond to a paid account isn’t worth their time, hopefully. This has a small chance of working but is really the only option other than time. Best of luck.  

2. Secondly there is the ""Pay for Delete"" option  

3. ""Try this: Write a letter to each credit bureau, asking them to investigate this account. Just say ""please  
 investigate this account, and make sure that it is being reported 100% accurately."" That often does the trick. If not, dispute various parts of the account. You could also write to the creditors, after disputing with credit bureaus, and tell them the account is being reported incorrectly. These strategies, in combination, often do the trick.""
4. Another thing to try is to send a debt validation letter. If they can’t provide it, the debt is removed. My wife had 5 things in collections when I met her. After sending the letters, three were removed. You can just Google debt validation letter for the template




From my knowledge, tactics 1 and 3 can reset the accounts timeframe. I have disputed it once a couple of years ago on Credit Karma, no dice. Personally they've sent me letters trying to settle for half of it and during a phone call specifically said they wouldn't delete it off my credit. I'm not too inclined to pay at this point. 

I believe I'll try strategy number 4 through certified mail. For those of you with more experience, does that seem like a solid attack plan? my score source is Credit Karma",1648696472

I even submitted evidence to the former lender showing that it was paid in full in 2018, including tracing numbers that I was able to get from my bank. After two months and dozens of phone calls and voicemails later, I finally hear back from the individual I was told was handling it (but only by calling from an unassociated number - I suspect they were ghosting me and sending my calls to voicemail from my normal phone). I requested that because they caused me years of hardship by falsely reporting to the bureaus, that they remove the file all together.

Long story short:

Amazon purchase for some reason went on an old account that I closed a long time ago.  Amazon doesn't notify me of this and instead immediately sends this debt to collections.  I receive a collections letter from TRS Recovery Services and immediately get on with Amazon and see no messages, errors, nothing strange in the invoice and I chat with their customer service.

&#x200B;

Amazon customer service told me TRS is a scam!  I filed a dispute and inquiry with TRS, but never heard back.  I eventually call TRS and they go over my Amazon account with me and show me where a disabled bank account was used on a purchase. I have no idea why but there it was.

&#x200B;

I get back on with Amazon and ask why they didn't e-mail me or message me or tell me anything other than my order went through.  Why they then told me TRS was a scam and that there was nothing wrong with my account and they had no real answer.

&#x200B;

I contacted an attorney and she said it wasn't in her wheelhouse and gave me some others to contact.  She said to meanwhile tell Amazon my rights were violated and try to resolve it internally by having them revoke the fees and collections file.

  
Meanwhile I contact Amazon who tells me they will do just that and it won't end up on my credit report, and to call TRS and pay the original item amount and nothing more.  I call TRS and they will only let me pay in full, with fees and all, and they explain that even paying this amount will be sent to the credit bureaus.  They tell me Amazon does not have such forms and does not have authority on any TRS accounts, that it's a done deal and I have to pay and that it will be reported.

Now I am on chat with Amazon and they keep sending me to the wrong teams... Spanish Team, Furniture Assembly, Fresh Produce...  How do I trust any of this?  I would just pay it but I was told if I pay it, it will report to bureaus.  If I don't, it will report to bureaus.  What do I do?",1648684499

$4,500 in CC debt
$1,400 in personal loan with high interest
$11,000 in collections (I’ve been sued but I worked a payment plan with the collection agency)

Because my score dropped below 700 and remained under 700, my bank, Huntington, continually dropped my credit limit to just above what my monthly charges were, to the point that my current limit is a hair above $200.

This is obviously not enough to last me a full month for each payment, so I have to constantly pay off my current balance just to regain access to my account, but this means that the statements often show little to no active balance due, which means I'm effectively not paying off any debts, and therefore not increasing my score at all.

I'm not sure what to do besides max out my credit limit and start taking out cash for every other payment made the rest of the month. Are there any other options?

I had a Target Credit card I got in 2014, I made my last payment in 2016, then stopped paying. It says closed in account status, remarks say charged off as bad debt and cancelled by credit grantor. Under payment status, payment history says ""--"" and worst payment status says ""No info"". Under account deals, for times 30/60/90 days late, it shows ""0/0/0"". Last reporting date 3/26/22.

A few questions...
1. Are any of those items that show ""--"", ""no info"", or ""0/0/0"", reasons that I could dispute it? Or are they just like that because the account has been closed?
2. If they are still reporting this recently/frequently, that means it's in collections, right? How do I know? It doesn't say the name of a collection agency. Contact info at the bottom still says TD Bank. So it's in collections, but still with them?
3. I haven't received any mail or anything about this. I did have this card and I did stop paying, yes. But I'm not receiving any notices from them, or any debt collector. I have moved since having this card, maybe they have my old address? Could I dispute for this reason?


The above info was in my TransUnion, I just looked at it under Experian, and the last payment dates and the account closed dates are different between the 2 bureaus. Experian also shows 3/1/3 for times 30/60/90 days late while TransUnion shows 0/0/0. Any possible reason to dispute here? Someone's gotta be wrong, if they both have different information, right?

The amount that I owe is not showing up in my ""collections"" balance on credit karma. It's not showing up in derogatory marks. Just under accounts/closed accounts.

Hi All,

Thank you in advance:

I have a great credit score, or at least used to have 760-800... until a a few months ago I received a collection on my account from RADIUS GLOBAL SOLUTION in the form of $489 unpaid dentist debt, which I immediately picked up the phone, called RADIUS who confirmed that the collection will get deleted if I paid. The collection did get remove from my Equifax and TransUnion who both show 762 / 809 scores at the moment but my Experian report is still showing the collection and messing up my scores with 668 ""Fair"".

* Experian FICO8 score: 668
* Equifax FICO8 score: 762
* TU FICO8 score: 777

I called Experian on Monday, asking to dispute the collection and explained that as soon as I became aware I paid and RAIDUS said they will remove the collection, I just received an email that my dispute results are ready:

The information you disputed has been verified as accurate; however, information unrelated to your dispute has been updated. Please review your report for the details.

Essentially, the insurance paid off my remaining balance and told me I was good to go. However, my last payment to the car financer ended up bouncing because of the closed checking account. After this, they claim I owed them the last payment - however they never communicated that to me.

Since it was closed about a year ago I have been making consistent, on-time payments (above the minimum.) My question is: do payments on a closed account contribute to positive payment history on my credit report? The balance is now under 20% of the limit, and if I were to pay it down to $0 now, it would add one more on-time payment to my credit history. If I paid the minimum, I could add another 10 months of positive payment activity to my credit report. Do closed accounts with a balance actually contribute to payment history? Or do credit reports only factor in payment history from currently open accounts?

I hope this is clear, I'm trying to decide between paying off the closed account in full and getting one more positive payment on my credit reports, or drawing it out so that I gain 10 more positive payments on the reports to push my % of on-time payments higher (currently 96%, every payment helps push it higher.)

Additionally, since I'm technically still adding payment history to my credit report, has this closed account been contributing to my average age of credit / length of credit history with each monthly payment? If I stretched the payments out for another 10 months, would it also technically add 10 more payments that contribute to the average age of credit?

I guess this isn't a very common scenario, since I have exhausted reddit threads and Google trying to find an answer for this specific case.

Last year I overdrew my bank account by $2000. I was in the height of an aggressive gambling binge (addiction) and I’ve seeked help since. 

Now when I over drew my account I had enabled a feature (months prior) to automatically reject any transactions if I was at a 0$ balance. It was like the opposite of over draft protection as I wanted to ensure that if I had 0$ in my balance no charges would go through. 

Well after burning almost 40,000$ in a weeks span (with multiple pending transactions) I ended up depositing another 2000 via PayPal ACH. Once everything had posted I had a -2000$ balance. I called the bank and asked them how I could even go into the negative if I specifically set up no over drafting for my account and the woman told me I had 90 days to pay it and that I could just move on with my life. 


Well I ended up getting further into my addiction and just let them close the account. I have multiple bank accounts and i just didn’t care. HOWEVER, now that I’m getting my head back on straight. I want to fix up my credit and move on with life. I received a letter from 1 collection agency in June and ever since then it’s been nothing. No phone calls, nothing on my credit report, nothing. When I pointed out how it’s not possible that I over drafted the woman on the phone seemed really frustrated. Is my debt potentially not valid? (Don’t rip me apart, I spent the money I know it’s valid) but in the eyes of the law / credit agency is it?

I have an old auto loan that's closed showing a balance of 1,6XX.00. It was the final interest payment I never paid, and there's some pretty bad payment history there. This was like 5 years ago. Saving to repair that car (and my current one) so I can sell it and pay off the loan. Is there anyway to get this off my CR before then? I thought that if something showed closed, you can't have a balance? Or something like that.

Student loans. Those are in default, but I expect them to be forgiven since the college robbed the govt of like a bagillion dollars and tons of students (including me). Sending in the paperwork on that this week. But they're showing closed with a zero balance because of the govt thing theyre doing right now. I think?

I'm using the extra card, [cred.ai](https://cred.ai) card, experian boost, and grow credit right now. i have a 97% approval chance with credit ones card based on experian and an outstanding chance for mission lanes cash back visa card through credit karma, but I don't want another hard pull.

So, I'd rather not apply, they require proof of income, I cant provide what they want, and then it's too bad.  I've tried petal, but they don't like me for whatever reason.

I don't have a mortgage or active auto loan. What other tools can I use, credit lines can i apply for, or loans should i have in order to get that good spread of diff accounts that would help my score? I don't care about high interest rates or even annual fees since I won't be using the card, unless I'm paying it in full or down to a dollar. I just want to boost my score as high as possible asap.

I’ve never used any form of credit before and this account was recently transferred to my name.
 (With my consent of course)
The account has a 200$ credit limit, and for the first 2 months I paid soon after the bill was issued. 

So I brought my remaining credit down to 80$ after my 120$ phone bill. 
Then paid what I owed within a day or so.
So my credit limit went back up to 200$.

Now the issue.
I was billed on October 5th and I forgot to pay that bill. 
Then I was billed again on November 5th and I forgot to pay again. 

So I passed my credit limit and my phone was shut off on the Morning of November 6th.

This is the first and only time I exceed my 200$ credit limit. 

So I realized my mistake and paid my first bill on November 6th then went to work. 
My remaining credit was at 70$ and I could use my phone. 

Then comes December 1st,
I pay the second bill I owed from November so my credit limit went up to 200$ again.


Scenario 2
Now on December 5th I was billed again.
So on December 8th I paid 60$ to “smartly” use the credit. 

But then forgot to pay until January 6th.
So I realized and paid the remainder of December’s bill on January 6th. 
My service was not cut off and I did not exceed my credit limit because I paid 60$ on December 8th.

Would my credit be negatively impacted in this second scenario? 
I don’t think so because I did not exceed my credit limit. 

Anyways I was billed on January 
5th and paid on the 25th. 

Since then I’ve been paying immediately after I am billed. 



Do you think the first scenario negatively impacted my credit.
I did exceed my credit limit within my bell account.
I have been funding it with a debit card. Not a credit card.
So hopefully that helps me. 

Honestly I’m a noob at this, and I’m planning on getting a credit card soon so I can build my my credit.  I’ll be doing more research on that.

I searched around on here and pieced together that, even if you're paying off bills on time, the bank or credit card company sends a report and the credit agency bases your score on the balance at that time. I could have that wrong. (The unending shifting goals drive me insane!)

I called my credit union and they said they send the report around the first of the month.

I was checking my auto loan at Chase, and decided to check my score tracking there, which is Experian Vantage 3.0. It showed a 42 point boost, to 713. While I've been tracking them, I've noticed my Vantage scores were always lower than my Fico's, so I signed up for the trial and forced a refresh at the Experian website.

I was expecting something modest, like 20-30 points. With my three active accounts, all in exceptional standing, the loss of the last of my negative history increased my Experian Fico from 706 to 785...... I don't even know what to say.

In Summer 2020, I received a letter from a collections agency regarding an unpaid utility bill for less than $200. This unpaid debt was reported on my credit reports and lowered my score from almost 800 to somewhere in the 600s. I did some digging and I in fact did miss paying my last bill in 2018 when I was moving apartments (utility company never reached out to me and I never checked their website since I thought I was fully settled and had moved to a different utility company).

I followed the advice on this sub and sent a debt validation letter to the collections agency and within a month or so, the hit was taken off my credit report and the collection agency sent some letter basically saying they would back off.

Now two years later I received a letter from a 2nd collections agency regarding the same debt. This time, my credit has not yet been hit. I am going to send another debt validation letter, but this company offered in their initial letter a 50% repayment to cease all future collections.

I am happy to pay the \~$100 to end all of this since the debt is actually correct, but wanted to see what the proper steps are to achieve this will end once and for all? Since my credit hasn't taken a hit this time, will paying this debt actually end the saga for good?

I assumed when the 1st agency backed off and removed the credit hit, this would be over, but I didn't know the debt could then move to another agency. I don't want this same thing to happen again if this 2nd agency also backs down and my credit could take a hit if a 3rd agency steps in when I plan on buying a house or car.",1648489485

The only difference between the 2 scores is the lower one has 2 hard inquiries the other doesn't.

Hi,

I've read a lot of about the credit repair process and have implemented  a lot of those tools. What question I have is if I should just wait for these to drop off versus getting on payment plans. I really didn't want to do this, since I can't really afford it at the moment and can't settle. I know there is always a risk of being sued, though. Getting on a payment plan would also mean that it would change the date of the last payment, and many of these cards would take a long time to pay off. It is really not something I can afford. Capital One, Amex are some creditors, which means I'm probably blacklisted. I have my own $5,0000 with no balance in case I need credit, some store cards, and an authorized /joint user for other cards totaling another 80k in credit. I know I owe them this debt, but worried I'll just be wasting my money at this point. Not looking to file bankruptcy at this point. Just curious to get some opinions.",1648429147

My average monthly spend on that card is around $100k and I have paid off the full balance every month. I want to open an Amex Business card in my own name and transition all of that spending to the new card. Will this positively affect my credit score?

222,In the Shopping Stage of Refinancing My Car... Not Sure Where to Start or Who to Trust,1,tpbo8s,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tpbo8s/in_the_shopping_stage_of_refinancing_my_car_not/,11,"Not sure if I should be asking this here or over at r/personalfinance, but I want to refinance my current auto loan after an expected score boost coming in a couple of months. Just shopping around at the moment, but looking to pull the trigger around May or so. This is my first auto loan, so I don't really know the ropes of refinancing.

My current loan is at 7%, $9100'ish payoff, 31 months remaining. I ran a pre-qual at the capital one website and they qualified me for a loan for around 5.6% interest on my 697 transunion fico score. That score includes 18 late payments on my report that'll be dropping off next month. I think I'll be able to do better than that come May, since the boost I'm hoping for might bump my profile into super-prime status.

I guess I'm just not sure what to trust when I run into sites that offer me rates like 2-3% (without pull) with my current score. I stumbled onto a site called WithClutch.com, which is where I'm seeing some of these super low rates. Does anyone have any experience with them? My Google searches aren't turning up much about them, but I did find an interview with a co-founder on youtube, which implied legitimacy. Their original business was sold to Carvana, and they left to start an online platform to help people refinance with just a few clicks.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: The original loan was $22k and the car currently bluebooks at around $20k, if the extra info is useful.",1648352330

I was a fairly successful one at that in my city. I would dj almost every night and was brought in over 100k in 2018.

I was looking for new jobs when I was in a car wreck and broke my leg. At this time I kidna gave up on life a dealt with pretty gnarly drug addiction and just kidna let all my responsibilities fade. Early 2020 my step dad had a major heart attack and my mom was now a single mom with no help for my autistic brother and sister. This woke me up and a I quit drugs and started helping my mom.

The loan was originally $30,000, but after interest and fees they tried to get me to pay $69,000.  We have agreed on a settlement of $32,500 but the lender is being a stickler about reporting it as ‘settled’ rather than ‘paid in full’ to the credit agencies.

it's me again.

right now i have a 824 FICO 8 credit score, with a credit profile consisting of: (1) Discover It Card with a $2000 limit, and (1) long term installment in the form of student loans which i begin being responsible paying back in May 2022. my credit age is 7 years.\*

it took me really long to complete undergrad due to health reasons, so my credit age is 7 years with my long term installment, student loans, being the longest.\*

&#x200B;

(see my 3 questions below)

&#x200B;

**a little bit about my experience with the discover it card:**

* **length:** 1.5 years
* **payment history:** always on time, and never missed a payment
* **utilization:** the first year, unfortunately, i had kept a consistent high utilization (pretty much maxed out) up until January 2022.  

   * ***since then, for the last 4 months i've reported a utilization of 0-4% \*\*\****  

      * this had resulted a major spike in my credit score leading to **upwards of 800, today: 824**
* **limit:** i started with $1500 limit, until this past week i asked for a credit limit increase; to which Discover only increased by $500 despite my significant increase of available income\* and decreased housing risk of living with my parents with $0 rent.  

   * ***current limit = $2,000***
* **other important info:** i recently successfully referred a friend to join Discover and I've activated AutoPay for the minimum due + $10, and i make at least 2+ payments in a single cycle

&#x200B;

**long term installment (student loans):**

Age: 7 Years.

Amount: \~20k which I begin to pay off in May

&#x200B;

**my questions are:**

 **1. i understand a good credit mix consists of 2 CC, 1 short term installment, and 1 long term installment. to expand my current credit mix, do you suggest i open a Line of Credit with a with a Co-Signer at a Credit Union, open a 2nd Credit Card, and/or Open a small Loan with a bank (also w a Co-Signer) ?**

&#x200B;

**2. OR do u rather suggest i work on bettering my credit mix \*only\* thru adding a 2nd CC for now?**

&#x200B;

**3. and lastly, the** **most** **important question:**

**\*WHEN\* do you think is a most favorable time for me to apply for my 2nd credit card/line of credit/loan given the aforementioned year's worth of high utilization (BUT no missed payments, and recently: at least 4 months of low utilization (0-4%), autopay activation, multiple payments in single cycle, successful friend referral, fair credit age of 7 years) i'm recovering from?**

Total Credit length or the Score itself since it takes that into account?

Background: I am 23, great credit history, one previous auto loan I got when I was 19 with my Dad as a cosigner, opened one credit card at 20, one at 21, and one more at 22. So my average credit history is around 2 years or so averaging all lines of credit. I have never missed a payment and have a FICO of high 730s, sometimes 740s. I see my score through experian.

I have owned outright my current car for 4 years and love it, but I will be driving a lot more and do not want to put more mileage on current car. It also gets 15mpg which I just cant handle as I plan to drive 30k miles this year. We want a new car that gets good gas mileage that wont depreciate too much with putting miles on. My income is around $3-5k/month.

I found a 2015 car with 30k miles on it with a rebuilt title. Yeah, I know not many people like them but I like them because I know cars very well and am skilled at negotiating. I talked the seller down to selling the car for 50% of the value of the car. My credit union I have used for years for everything has a policy they will loan up to 60% to the value of the car. NADA has the car booked at $31k. I negotiated down to $16k and figured I would have no problem with getting the loan for the full amount.

After applying in person, they said that they could only approve me for a $10,000 loan, and would expect me to pay a $7k down payment. I talked with the rep and he said he didn't know why, so he went to talk to his manager about it. They then escalated the app to corporate and said it would be undergoing review. He only speculated my shorter credit history may have something to do with it.

My question is:

If credit length is included in your credit score, why do banks and credit unions even look at length?

Could it just be that the system is changing and they are no longer willing to loan 60% value of rebuilt titles?

Would I have the same problem trying to buy a car for more $$ at a dealership either through my CU or their alternatives? As opposed to a private seller.

-This month marks 7 years since I filed for CH7 bankruptcy. 

-No reported collections. 

-2 installment loans. Auto loan opened 3 months ago and already 8% paid off. Refinanced student loan that is 3.5 years old but only 7% paid off. I haven’t made a payment in the last 2 years because of the federal forbearance. 

-5 unsecured charge cards. Reported Utilization is less than 1%. 3 of the charge cards of carry a small reported monthly balance (less than $30 each). 

-3 hard pulls, but I believe they only count as one because they are all for my recent auto loan and pulled on the same day. 

-1 “30-59 day late” payment from June 2015 on a closed auto loan account.

253,824 FICO 8 Credit Score : 1 CC and 1 Long Term Installment / Advice,0,to97ks,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/to97ks/824_fico_8_credit_score_1_cc_and_1_long_term/,18,"hi all,

i'm a little new to credit and was wondering how i should go forward with the goals i wish to achieve by the **end of the year** while nurturing my high healthy credit score as much as i can:

1) Lease a car

2) Lease an apt

&#x200B;

right now i have a 824 FICO 8 credit score, with a credit profile consisting of: (1) Discover It Card with a $2000 limit, and (1) long term installment in the form of student loans which i begin being responsible paying back in May 2022. my credit age is 7 years.\* 

it took me really long to complete undergrad due to health reasons, so my credit age is 7 years with my long term installment, student loans, being the longest.\*

&#x200B;

**a little bit about my experience with the discover it card:** 

&#x200B;

* **length:** 1.5 years 
* **payment history:** always on time, and never missed a payment
* **utilization:** the first year, unfortunately, i had kept a consistent high utilization (pretty much maxed out) up until January 2022. 
   * ***since then, for the last 4 months i've reported a utilization of 0-4% \*\*\****
      * this had resulted a major spike in my credit score leading to **upwards of 800, today: 824**
* **limit:** i started with $1500 limit, until this past week i asked for a credit limit increase; to which Discover only increased by $500 despite my significant increase of available income\* and decreased housing risk of living with my parents with $0 rent. 
   * ***current limit = $2,000***
* **other important info:** i recently successfully referred a friend to join Discover and I've activated AutoPay for the minimum due + $10, and i make at least 2+ payments in a single cycle

&#x200B;

**long term installment (student loans):** 

Age: 7 Years. 

Amount: \~20k which I begin to pay off in May

&#x200B;

**my questions are:** 

1. **i understand a good credit mix consists of 2 CC, 1 short term installment, and 1 long term installment. given i want to lease a vehicle soon, wouldn't creating a short term installment with my bank to finance a vehicle be one way to better my credit mix? should i apply for a 2nd cc regardless?**

2. **or instead, should i work on bettering my credit mix \*only\* thru adding a 2nd CC for now before i go seek a car/apt for the best rates?** 

3. **if so, when do you think is a MOST favorable time for me to apply for my 2nd credit card given the aforementioned year's worth of high utilization (BUT no missed payments, and recently: at least 4 months of low utilization (0-4%), autopay activation, multiple payments in single cycle, successful friend referral, fair credit age of 7 years) i'm recovering from?**

&#x200B;

**thanks so much in advance :-)**",1648253486

259,Lost.. What’s Next?,3,tnos0l,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tnos0l/lost_whats_next/,3,"I started at 630, I’m lost, how I got my points up in 3 months to 681 FICO and 667 for score reported to TransUnion, the other is 390 etc, I only care of TransUnion, it’s always the lowest plus the same as on my Discover card. 

Ok I’m frustrated because I feel it’s not fast enough, I don’t have 8 years or 15. To see 800, I’m fine with having a  725 or of course would take more at least and my FICO at 750, not sure how long I will live, it’s complicated, I look very normal but dying within, like to enjoy life for the next several years. 

I’d like to ideally have my credit to this number at 725  by January, Is this unrealistic? I’m sick of hearing not always denied. 
Ok for bills 

I owe 3,680 for my last credit card, rest zero  I have 4 small ones. I co-signed for two trucks but my husband and I,  one is 23,000 his but I’m listed first, he second one is 34,000 this I’m second and is a 2021 Colorado. 

For loans I’m down to 3,800 2 is 1,600 3rd is 2,700.  Last I co-sign for hubby and I home repairs we owe 11,000 now so have brought that one with litestream, I always try to pay extra, this credit card has been good to me. 

It angers me from one loan listed above because Its paid down to paid 3,810, was reporting but stopped, for months now still sitting at 4,779 or 4,690. TransUnion is the 4779  Trust me I blow up the loan companies phone , never a supervisor to talk to, and investigations to the point all three credit bureau’s won’t let me put another one it, they all three say investigating. 
Any ideas anything I can do on this high end loan that was 11,000 high risk loan of 33 percent!!  ? 

Anyway am lost, why did my score go to 636 to now in 3 months, I pay all or have payment arrangements ( all medical) not on my credit. I have one negative paid off bc Kay’s did me wrong, Genisis refused to budge, but they are fixing the dates they closed, I did not miss 90 days. We were supposed to have a promo from Kay’s but not! We have paid right on the spot, paid off the rest, last dime. As I told them to check out the records, I only get 14 months, covid I paid all my bills, even in the hospital I had on direct pay as I sat in the icu, huge surgery with bad complications. I’ve never gone into collections, I’d know I was late during covid on my report, so they are investigating the dates which is a plus or I went over balance when I only bought two small items. I do believe this will be fixed. 
I’m though very happy at 3 months ago I was at 630 not 667 and my FICO at 681
 
My Goal and is it possible? 
I am trying to get to 700 without using  any of my cards  until at a 0, will use to buy a tank of gas, pay before ending cycle, next time the other card. Right now all are at 0, nor want to apply for a loan at this time at all! Any suggestions how? 
My revolving state 34 or 36 on some 
48 percent credit used some 51?? 
But one of the credit reports is killing me stating I need to re- finance our  trucks, not happening, my truck is almost a year old, why I refuse to, plus my husbands truck, we are almost there next year, it’s not that high financing except though low I hate Wells Fargo, feel in another year to find a better deal. 
I believe I only trust TransUnion than the rest to follow my credit & Discover Card. 
Btw credit revolving is 72 ( I only owe 3800 which I just paid again to 3600 

Revolving Accounts -67credit-  
Current 72 utilization
And 67 for credit card current use so am lost!

So back in 2015-2018 I had multiple late payments on one credit card (charged off) and my car (I have since paid it off and sold it)
I also had two bills go to collections.  One from Sallie Mae and another from care credit. 
And several payday loans went to collections as well. 
At one point my score was around 470. 

Since then, I’ve paid off most of my debt. Sallie Mae and care credit are showing payments being made and for Sallie Mae it will take the derogatory marks off after 9 months of consecutive payments.  

I haven’t had a late payment in about 3 years now. I use Experian and pay for it and my credit score is showing 628 for Experian, 629 for Equifax, and 650 for trans Union. My bank switched from FICO to Vantage and shows me at 623.


We recently applied for a rental and for once I wasn’t as concerned about credit.  However I was told my score was 577.  It showed the late payments from the car (understandable) and an old credit card that was charged off back in 2017.  It also showed my current credit card with no late payments and an installment loan I have.  

I’m just so confused.  I’ve been monitoring all 3 bureaus and none of it was in the 500s.  Part of the report from the rental place said I didn’t have enough lines of credit so I opened a new credit card with capital one (I don’t Plan on using it more than once a month and paying it off in the same month) but I haven’t had a late payment in years.  I keep waiting for my collection debt to be taken off cause I feel like that will raise it by a lot but now I’m not so sure.

I applied last Friday with a banker and heard today that they denied it because my consumer card with them had ""not been open long enough."" It's been open since 2018 with perfect payment history and never carried a balance. The banker agreed that should be long enough and asked for the last 6 months statements and payments with Amex to resubmit. Also perfect payment history and no carrying a balance.

Long story short. I am looking to pay the charged off account in the next coming days.

Will they close my active account?

Please hear me out. Why I have distrust. I recently disputed the charged off account through my bureaus. During the dispute the stupid fucking bureaus decided to dispute the active account as well. So there's a fucking message on the active account about this dispute. I never asked them to touch my active account.

With this same reason I fear Capital One during this settlement offer I am about to give them will close the other active account. I don't want them to touch or even to acknowledge that account. It's in great standing helping me build credit and has a long credit age.

Last thing, is it possible to have a successful PFD with Capital One? Can I try? If so, how should I go about it? I don't want to do PFD because of the above reasons. In fact, I don't even want to settle. I want to sneakily go in there pay it off and then never have anyone look at my other account.

349,Pay For Delete with collections history vs charge off,1,tk8217,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tk8217/pay_for_delete_with_collections_history_vs_charge/,3,"Hello all, wonderful sub you've got here.

I made some stupid decisions a couple years ago when money was tight, and I stopped paying off two credit cards that were store cards for Best Buy (Citi) and Guitar Center (synchrony). Both of those last payments were around June 2020.  

Those accounts are now in collections: synchrony is with PRA, and citi is with LVNV (ERC). There's been some damage done to my credit score, not too terrible luckily, though I'd still like to handle these in the best possible way towards my score now. 

I got my 3 credit reports and sure enough both of those are on there as collections accounts. What I'm not understanding is, there's absolutely nothing indicating a ""charge off"" occurred explicitly, which confuses me because I thought an account being in collections means there must be a charge off as well. Even with equifax (I think it was that one, I don't have the report in front of me), they have a code ""CO"" specifically for charge off and its nowhere in my report, though there are the collections accounts. Even weirder to me, the original 2 credit cards, which I had made payments to both for a while, don't show up at all in any of the reports, only the collections accounts.

I know charge offs are horrible for your report, so this gives me some excitement. Further, I know PRA does pay for delete (and they've told me this explicitly in the letter and online), and from reading online people's luck with pay for delete with LVNV is good as well.

**My 1st question is**: If I have nothing in my report about charge offs, and these collections will delete their tradeline after I've paid, does that mean there'll be no record of the charge off?! The original 2 credit cards (which I had made payments to for a while) actually *don't show up at all* in any of my reports. Only the collections accounts. Is it possible after the tradelines are delete, the original charge offs/accounts will start showing all of a sudden?

**2nd Question**: PRA specifically says I can pay the full amount and it will mark the account ""paid in full"", or I can do a lower amount and it will mark ""paid in less than full"". If I know that  PRA will delete the tradeline after 30 days as per their policy anyway, is there any reason whatsoever to pay the full amount, or should I just go with the settled? I assume there'll be a similar deal with LVNV/ERC.

3rd, unrelated, bonus question: been paying an auto loan that's almost over for 5 years now with a local credit union, perfect record, but that shows up nowhere on my report. Is there a process to go through to get the account in my credit history? Should I just call them and see what they say?",1647969638

The changes are as follows and will go into effect in July:

•Medical debt that was paid after it was sent to collections will be removed from reports!

•Unpaid medical debts won’t get added to credit reports for a full year after being sent to collections

•Removal of unpaid medical debt of less than $500 (won’t go into effect until first half of next year and could be increased from $500)

The changes come in response to the CFPB announcing it planned to hold credit reporting firms accountable for inaccurate reporting when it comes to medical debt. This isn’t the first time the CFPB has looked into this issue with a 2014 report showing that medical debt and non medical debt aren’t equivalent when it comes to determining a consumers credit worthiness. In 2015 changes were made that meant medical debt wasn’t added for 180 days.

It’s expected that these changes announced by the consumer reporting agencies will remove approximately 70% of medical debt currently reported on consumers reports. Most new scoring models discard or reduce the importance of medical debt as it’s not a great indicator of credit worthiness, so these changes shouldn’t come as a surprise.

I have a 2017 Jeep Compass with about 80,000 miles, and there's about 12,000$ left on the loan. It's starting to have issues and the Jeep is worth more then what's owed (around $18,000 is what it's worth that I've appraised online). I figured I'd just go down and get something new. I make about 40,000$ a year pre taxes. My CScore is a 710 on Experian.

The dealership wouldn't let me get a car without a cosigner. This makes no sense as this would be my third car (had a focus, then the jeep, then the newer car I was trying to buy) and the first two I had to have NO co signer. In fact, my debt, income, and credit was way worse, and then they were willing to give me better payments, and better percent rates. Which again - I don't get.

It was midly annoying as I was literally filling out paperwork and able to test drive it and they were like ""lol nope, we will call you if anything changes!"", after I'd been there for like, 3 hours?

I guess I""ll drive this until the wheels fall off and I own it outright,  but I'm trying to figure out why I needed a cosigner.

At the time, I had a few parking tickets that i was going to pay, but since I wasn’t planning on seeing the bike again, I never paid them. I had auto pay on for the payments and never missed a single one; despite not even being in possession of the bike. 7-8 months later in June/July of 2020, the sheriffs department located the bike while serving a warrant and had me come pick it up. I took it to the mechanic to have it repaired. I got it back about a month later and by that time, the old parking tickets totaled up to about $1400; preventing me from registering it right away. On my way home, I was pulled over and the motorcycle was impounded for expired tags. By the time I had enough money for the registration, the tow fees were $1700. I then surrendered it to the finance company, knowing they would sell it at an auction and hopefully take some money off the principal of my loan.

When I was a dumb college kid, I maxed out my credit card which had a $3,500.00 credit limit. I lost my job during that time and was unable to pay for it. The account was closed and it was deemed a “charge off.”

Fast forward to 2022, I now have a big boy job and I want to build my credit. I called WF and made an agreement to pay off the owed balance, but the account/card won’t be opened again because it’s been closed for 3+ years. My mom was able to add me as an authorized user for one of her credit cards so that has helped my credit score a little (I think). I’m currently at 589 (according to Experian FICO 8). 

Where can I go from here? I will finish paying off the $3,500 in July and want to build my credit so that I’m able to purchase a house in the next 3-4 years.

I’ve never purchased a car or taken out any type of small loan (for furniture, electronics, etc). I’ve tried to put furniture into payments but was denied.

Thank you in advance for any advice that can be provided. 

My daughter died in 2018 three days after being transported to a NICU by an ambulance company. She was retroactively added to our insurance plan and all related medical bills were covered. 

About one year later I received a bill from the ambulance for about $8000 that was not billed to the insurance. After speaking with the ambulance company I was informed that my insurance claim was denied because my daughter was not on the plan. I spoke to my insurance company who verified that she was covered and asked that the ambulance company resubmit the claim. I relayed the information to the ambulance company who agreed to resubmit the claim. I thought that it was resolved. 

Tonight I received a notification of a “major derogatory” on my credit. I discovered that the ambulance bill was sent to collections, though I never received any notification that the account was in collections. 

I filed disputes with each of the credit agencies, though I’m not optimistic that the dispute will help with the derogatory. 

There is no record of a claim on my insurance account, though I’m not sure if it would appear because my daughter was removed after her death. Can the insurance company be compelled to pay the outstanding amount to the collections agency? Or am I stuck with this financial obligation?",1647837473

Too late, I found these on my credit report and was not in a place financially to repay them. These bills had gone to collections. Three of them were around 400, and another was about 1400.

There are no changes to my numbers (vantage, I believe, but maybe fico.i don't think so tho), and no explanations as to why they've disappeared.

In doing a bit of research I saw that sometimes a new agency will buy from the old one and wondering, first, if it's likely that that is what happened and they haven't been reported yet, and secondly, if that resets or affects the drop-off date or statute of limitations.

The biggest credit-reporting firms will strip tens of billions of dollars in medical debt from consumers’ credit reports, erasing a black mark that makes it harder for millions of Americans to borrow.

Equifax Inc., Experian and TransUnion are making broad changes to how they report medical debt beginning this summer. The changes, which have been in the works for several months, will remove nearly 70% of medical debt in collections accounts from credit reports.


Beginning in July, the companies will remove medical debt that was paid after it was sent to collections. These debts can stick around on a consumer’s credit report for up to seven years, even if they are paid off. New unpaid medical debts won’t get added to credit reports for a full year after being sent to collections.


The firms are also planning to remove unpaid medical debts of less than $500 in the first half of next year. That threshold could rise, according to people familiar with the matter",1647610659

 I have one debt that's a charge off but they haven't been reporting monthly.

Hello all,

First off, sorry if my explanation is horrible, if more details are necessary , I will do my best to add them in the thread. I just recently found this subreddit and have been reading a whole lot on Collections and what to do when one shows in one’s credit report.

So reason I’m even asking questions about collections is because my girlfriend recently found out through looking at her Equifax report through CreditKarma, that she has an account in collections from an apartment complex that she lived in back in college, which was ~4 years ago.

The collection shows for 204$, opened 4 yrs ago, with a date reported of 3/3/2022 and no date of delinquency.

To her knowledge, she has never received a call, email, or mail with regards to this collection, and if it weren’t because she recently checked her credit report in quite a while (because she recently got her first credit card), she wouldn’t even know that she had an account in collections.

I took it a little further and found out it doesn’t show on her TU report, but it does show on Experian. So EX and EQ show the account.

I’m honestly unsure what she needs to do to get this off her credit report and I’m seeking tips or steps and what she can do next to get this resolved ASAP. An ideal scenario would be that this doesn’t have to stay on her credit report for 7 years.

So what would you all recommend?

Dispute? Call the original creditor and see what’s going on? Send a debt validation letter to the collector? Ignore it (although it seems that this is not the best answer)?

Sorry if I sound like a newb, I’ve never had to deal with collections, and I would hate for this to come back and bite my girlfriend back if she ignores it. She’s looking into getting a car financed soon and I’d hate for her to get a higher APR cause of this.

Many thanks in advance. Look forward to some tips on this.",1647652126

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

June 17th 2018 I signed a contract with a gym in South Carolina and never ended up going. I was freshly 18 and very irresponsible. I never made a single payment towards the gym, and on March 5th 2019 I received my final email from the gym notifying me that I was delinquent and would be sent to collections soon. These notifications were sent to an email I no longer used, and I honestly had zero idea I was even receiving them.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I received a call from a collections agency and I'm going to try and describe how the conversation went to the best of my memory, without giving the details of which company it was. Idk if that would somehow come back to bite me.

C: Hello am I speaking with x?

x: Yes that's me who is this?

C: This is soandso with the collections company, how are you.

x: I'm fine, I'm pretty sure I don't owe any debt, but before we start if I do, do you guys have any kind of grace period that I can pay within before it's reported to my credit?

C: Well actually this account was reported to your credit back in 2018, for Gym with an amount of $942.

x: No that doesn't sound right.. I have nothing negative on my credit and I think you have the wrong person.

C: Oh okay

x: Yea sorry wrong number, have a good one

Call ended

&#x200B;

So here are the facts and what I think I know.

Facts:

* Nothing has been reported to my credit
* This is the first time I've received a call or any kind of notification about this debt from this agency.
* The address used on the contract was a friends house that cannot be tied to me in any way
* They do not have my SSN

What I think I know:

* South Carolina has a statute of limitations of 3 years for debts, which starts on the first day I failed to make payment
* A collections company cannot report a debt to the credit bureaus that has surpassed the statute of limitations

&#x200B;

How do you guys think I should handle this? Should I just ignore it? I feel like if they were able to report me to the credit bureaus it would have happened years ago. Are they able to still report me even though it has been over 3 years? I have no problem paying the debt, or even twice that amount if it means my credit will be intact, but I don't want to make any moves that could screw me. Thank you to anyone that can help inform me on my situation.",1647648731

Had a first and second mortgage. Both were discharged in bankruptcy and we wanted to keep the house so our attorney advised us to keep paying the first mortgage, but not the second since the house was ""underwater""

6 years later we now have equity in the house even when you add in the discharged second mortgage. We are in Michigan and even though the second mortgage debt is discharged, the original bank still holds a lien on the house. So we cant sell or re-finance until that lien is settled. 

This is like waking a sleeping bear. The second lien holder has never threatened foreclosure and usually just sends a letter once a year about the balance owed to release the lien. I respond with a lower amount to release the lien and never hear back. Debt was $38,000 when discharged.

Should i just pay what they want to have the lien released? Or is any negotiation possible here?",1647647635

There's not. Everything is clean on all 3 bureaus, nothing in default, there should be no reason they're calling. 

I would love your advice, but our current options seem to be

I’ve been trying to turn my credit around over the past 2 years. I’ve seen about 200 points in growth and have been holding steady around 720 for the past few months, growing about 1 to 2 points every few weeks and topping out recently at 730. I have a few credit cards with a total credit limit of 9000, and I’ve been keeping my utilization below 5%. I’ve also been paying interest on my student loans, not on the loans themselves due to the freeze. 

Recently my score suddenly dropped 38 points. Credit Karma and Experian didn’t give me any reasons as to why, but Credit Sesame gave two reasons.. 1. The date that you opened your oldest account is too recent. 2. Lack of sufficient relevant real estate account information. 

Does anyone know what thats about? I’ve been diligent about staying on top of factors that affect my credit, so I was a little blindsided by this. Is there anyone I can call to ask about this? I’m considering talking to one of those credit defense agencies, if it might be some type of error. 

I’m getting ready to move to a new state in a  few months and would like to have my credit as high as possible while shopping for apartments. I’m considering asking two of my sisters to add me to one of their oldest credit cards to raise my credit limit and credit age, and hopefully my score. Before I even ask them I have to know, is there any possible way them adding me a card would hurt their score. I’m learning credit is a very finicky, unpredictable beast. Once they add me, I would have the card delivered to their homes and destroyed, to ease any worry of me spending on the card. This would be performative of course, since we both know I would never go spending on their card. Id hope to stay on their cards for about a year, and I do realize that any growth I may have seen will fall off once I’m removed.

I am writing this out of frustration from the credit system. I am in my mid thirties and always had a great credit score(760+). My wife and I earn good money(350k+) and have multiple cards. We always pay our balances in full 💯 of the time.

 We were travelling last year internationally and unfortunately I caught COVID and forgot to pay a bill of only $90 on one of my credit cards for 2 months as I forgot to setup auto-pay on it. I got to know when I recovered but by that time the Bank had closed my credit card and filed a delinquency on my credit card. I paid the money immediately at that point but my credit score took a dive and went into early 600s. Since then I have made the right payments, opened new cards at safe intervals, took a few repair loans but even then my credit has just inched to 690s. 

The problem is that now we want to buy a house. We are  in California (Bay area) and the price of homes is high which means that I am not able to get approval for enough mortgage because of less than 700 credit score. Even If I do, I am getting very high rates with high down-payment and reserve requirements. This will cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars more over the lifetime of mortgage.

I have written to the bank about the situation and really requested them to remove this from my credit report. I am not sure if that will work. I am looking for any advice or pointers that might help me in this situation.

Offcourse I am utterly frustrated with this unjust system. I am a permanent resident and moved to the US about 5 years ago. Why is the credit system and algorithms so unjust and stupid as to not take into account even the amount of a late payment vs how much I spend every month and pay taxes. $90 freaking bucks over 1 month due to forgetfulness is causing me so much financial burden so as to cost me hundreds of thousands. Why don't the people in US talk about this utter stupid calculation. Why is the amount of late-payment/debt vs earning not taken into account. Why is there no ratio calculated. Even when a person earns respectable amount of money, he can really be treated like shit for not paying freaking $90 for 2 months!!?  Is there no legal way to contest this anywhere?

I’ll try to keep it short, and sweet with 100% transparency (probably going to end up being long). I’m a 26-year-old male that’s starting a new job in the tech industry as a Engineer.

This will what I consider my first “major” job as the previous job was 1099 work, I did make about 35k doing that, and before that was retail sales where I was making about 47k. I only left the retail job to do 1099 work because I needed experience in order to get the role I’m fortunate enough to now have. I made some mistakes in my early 20’s such as running up credit cards, and not being able to pay them off resulting in them being sent to collections or being charged off. I’m working on getting that all fixed up by submitting letters for Pay for Delete, Debt Verification or Goodwill Letters all of that is something I’m working with Credit Boards forums to improve my credit score to remove as much negatives I can. Another thing I know I screwed up on is not starting a 401k with my previous retail employer where they were matching up to 5%, to be honest I was living pay check to pay check before, and never really understood 401k stuff or bothered with it. I’ll make a list below outlining where I stand with current expenses, and some details followed by questions I’m seeking answers for in order to guide me down the right path this time.

Calvary Portfolio Services had a credit card of mine in collections. On their website they say that when they close their accounts (either paid in full or settled) they request that the item be deleted from your credit report. 

That struck me as a great way for a CA to get people to agree to pay anything. They don't guarantee it is deleted, so they could very likely not try at all but say they did. Or they could honestly try and rope people in with success stories. Either way, the carrot is there to draw you in.

I was going to try to settle no matter what because I need a short term boost to my score. So I called and negotiated a settlement. When it came time for info about deleting, the agent I was speaking to told me they could not put it in writing that they would ask for a delete. He said the templates for their written agreements were already set and couldn't be changed but they do request the items be deleted.

I conceded and agreed to pay thinking there was a big chance I was not going to have it deleted and lo and behold within a week or two it was off my Experian report (haven't checked the other yet).

That was \~$1200 that I paid $650 to settle and it was deleted from my report.

I'm new to this subreddit but I've been reading a few posts and it turns out that a lot of people have gotten good advice from here. So it inspired me to do this post. 

First of all I want to introduce myself. My name is Adam and I'm currently 26 years old with around $13k of debt. My FICO score is around 480 and it's all due to my bad decisions I'm not going to sugar coat anything. My first credit card was from Wells Fargo with a $500 limit that was when I was around 21 years of age. I used to hear and there and I knew the basics of having to pay it off on time. Did that for about a few months and it did help my score go up. I was getting invitations to credit cards left to right. I was also enrolled in school at the time and I wanted a new computer. $500 wasn't going to get me the computer I wanted so I decided to open up a Best buy credit card. I got accepted with a 2k limit. I got the computer I wanted and paid it off. So I thought that I had good credit card habits for about a year and a half. I was working a part-time job and on my third year of school I had no financial aid. So all the money I had to spend was my part time job. I thought that's when things started to go downhill. Me having pride and wanted to do things on my own I didn't want to ask my parents for help. My part-time job money while it helped it wasn't enough. So that's when I started using my CCs. My thought process was I'll use my CCs to buy and pay for stuff I need and then pay off with my job money. Yeah that didn't work out. My spending on my CC's far exceed what I can really pay. I did try keeping it to essential items only but as naive college student that knew nothing about credit I also splurged on items I didn't need. I was able to keep paying the minimum but seeing how much interested I was racking up discouraged me. 
So I ended up using this company called Tally. I put all my debit into that account and that was around $5k. So all my debit was all consolidated into this tally account. You would think I'll just focus and pay that off but no. I kept using my credit cards as well and again I was in debit. Not only did I have to pay Tally $5k but I had my Best Buy credit  around $2.9k and an Amazon Chase card for $3k I don't even know how I managed to do that.

 I kept paying the minimum on everything until 2020. When COVID impacted my work. At that time I had a full-time job and was making decent money. I was able to pay off what I could but the interested in all my cards was to high it felt I wasn't doing anything just keeping my credit score from dropping ever so slightly. Then around the end of 2020 I lost my job. That was around November and that's when it really just went to shit. I wasn't able to get to pay anything on time. I was trying to get a job left to right but I didn't get any calls back. I was jobless for about 4 months. I didn't pay any of my debt during that time and they all went to collection and got charged off. 

I tried filing for Bankruptcy but my parents found out and they discouraged me from doing it. They said I had to man up and fix this myself and not choose the easy way. So I didn't go through with it.

Now I'm at a point where im not sure what to do. What should I tackle on first? I've used Chimes Cr for builder but I'm not sure if that is going to help a ton. At this point I'm so lost. Should I try to settle all the debits? Should I try Bankruptcy again? Or do I let them age out? 

I'm 26 and I can't believe I let my credit go down this bad. I have plans for the future like marrying my current gf and I just feel all that has to be put on hold because of my mistakes. So if someone can please tell me what they did or how would they go about it I'll appreciate it.

This story is all over the place a lot of things were left out but I feel like I would write a whole three page essay just explain everything in detail. So I apologize if things don't make sense.",1647475126

476,rehabbed student loan default still appearing when lender pulls my credit,2,tfzds6,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tfzds6/rehabbed_student_loan_default_still_appearing/,4,"TLDR
Long story short
Years ago I rehabbed mt defaulted student loan 
When my broker pulled my credit my old defaulted student loan is still showing up 
I know as a fact it was successfully rehahbed 
It doesn't show up for me on credit karma as a collection anymore
I called the loan servicer and they said my account is in good standing.
They told me to call default resolution group
DRG told me I have a zero balance and I should be all good
DRG told me I should open a dispute with the bureau so they can investigate and correct it
I have no idea what to do or If a dispute is even a good idea
How is this even possible if all the relevant parties are telling me im all good why would the bureau have such old information, like two years old at this point.


Full context

Okay so, like the title says. I had a defaulted student loan from when times were tougher in my life years ago. At one point a couple years ago I decided to get it on track so I called and set everything up to rehabilitate my loan. 10 months later or so I got an email or something to that effect letting me know that my loan was out of default and in good standing. Cool, so fast forward to recently. My wife and I are looking for a house, and while talking to our lender to get pre approval they pulled my credit and apparently my defaulted student loan is still showing up for them. This confused me, because from everything I can see on credit karma they just show up as ""student loans"" and they're no longer listed as collections. I'm pretty sure my score went up at the point when they were rehabbed as well, but it was awhile ago. So I got on the phone with my loan servicer and they said my account is in good standing, it's currently in forbearance because of the govt pause on student loan payments but the secondary status is that pending the end of the forbearance it will re-enter repayment. Also, that I have auto payments set up despite the forbearance because I opted to continue paying anyway. So I got proof of that sent to me and showed it to the financer and they said okay great. When it came time to check my credit for a different mortgage product obviously it's STILL showing up as in default, despite there having been yet another month and another report to the bureaus that it's in good standing and no longer in default. So I called my servicer again and had them look at my account in as much detail as possible and they said there's literally nothing there showing it as being in default or anything other than what I've already said. They told me that they don't actually report the defaulted status of any loans as a servicer, and that when a loan goes into default it's handed off to default resolution group, gov and then he gave me a wrong number to some literal random man's cell phone. I found the actual number from the govt website and called them. The guy I spoke to there said that I am showing a zero balance and that from what he can see everything looks good as if after being rehabilitated it was transferred back to the servicer as it should have been. He said that because they don't hold the loan anymore they don't report anything to the credit bureaus on my account. I'm extraordinarily confused about this. Can anyone explain what in the world is going on here? I would really like to get pre-approved for a house and this is a dead in the water deal breaker for approval, and I thought I had done everything I was supposed to do to fix it years ago. 
My thought its possible that the servicer doesn't report to whatever specific bureau my financer uses but I haven't heard back from him yet and this is pretty urgent to me.",1647482923

Part of my inquiry is based on some new facts of what I’ve read on this sub. 

I had a health crisis back in 2016, combined with never making enough anyway at a job I had been at 10 years, I got in some real trouble.  I wound up racking up almost 6k of a 10k limit on an AMEX.  

Incredibly, AMEX is still holding this debt to this day.  They never sold it. My last payment would have been 2016.. 2017 at the very latest.  Now, the emails they send every-other-day state that can no longer sue for the debt—- it’s  past the statute of limitations.

Also, I can’t find this debt on my Experian  report.  If a bad debt falls off after 7 years, If I either settle with them or…. As I feel is the better thing —- pay it in full —am I just throwing away money for something that’s not even on my credit??

Same timeline.  I have back rent from an a corporate apartment community due.  Just over $5,000.  This is reporting, but they stopped collecting on it pretty much  a year ago.  This was March 2017 first missed payment.  I’m about two years from bad debt falling off 

I am going to need to sign a lease in the next 12-18 months, and I want to raise my credit.  I’m at 567 right now. Awful. 

I am thinking people will say here, pay the bad debt to the apartment as good faith. 

But then they always say, paying collections does nothing for your score.

Short of saving up $10k and paying off both in full so I get a paid in full on my he credit report,  what are the next best moves here putting my future first ?",1647483281

I filed disputes with the credit bureaus on the grounds that we approved the auto payments for the life of the loan so this was an issue with their card system.  The disputes were received on February 12 (31 days ago).

I plan to pay down this city double cash card significantly in the coming months as this is still active in my credit report.

My worry is if/when paid in full they will just immediately close the account and my credit history/ account history would take a hit. I was thinking I could pay it down so low that the interest wouldn’t be that big of a deal and make the small payments. The positive of this is that I could artificially make my utilization numbers look good for a brief period while shopping for a car loan. I can’t use this card and will likely never be issued another citi card although they said I could technically reapply for  another one. Doubt I will have any luck there though.

Already have Discover secured card (and have graduated to unsecured)

I'm in need of advice, CRedditors.

I am in my mid-20s. When I was just barely out of high school (\~18 yo), I had a medical procedure with a hefty bill that insurance should have covered but didn't, at first. After a lot of calls, my parent finally got insurance to cover the majority of it, but there was still a remaining amount of about $100 billed to us. My parent refused to pay that bill, and it was sent to collections. It has been on my credit report since 2016 and will not be removed until mid-2023.

Back in 2018 when my parent helped me apply for a few credit cards (I think 3 over the course of 1-1.5 years or so, I don't remember exactly), I got denied for every single one. My parent (who has a long and healthy credit history) even co-signed for another application with me in 2019, and we still got denied. I spoke with my other parent about this in 2020, and they prompted me to check my credit score and that is when I found out about the collection. This is the only negative entry on my credit reports from all 3 bureaus. I pay all of my bills (CC and other) on time in full and have never had a loan of any kind. My FICO score is around 660/670, though I did just get denied for another credit card that I applied for with my spouse, so that will probably be taking a hit due to the hard pull.

Until this most recent denial, I honestly kind of forgot about the collection because my parent told me there wasn't much I could do to get the collection removed. I know my first step is likely to try to pay that bill and ask for a goodwill deletion given the situation (I was 18 and was not really in charge of my own finances), but that could be unsuccessful. My question is, **how can I still build up my credit in the meantime while waiting for the collection to be removed?**

I got a secured card through Discover last year and have used it responsibly (I think I've technically graduated to unsecured). I am also an authorized user on some older accounts, giving me a good length of credit history. My spouse and I are hopefully planning to buy a house within the next 2-5 years, so I know I will need good credit to help improve our chances of getting a mortgage. All of the other secured cards available seem pretty meh compared to the Discover one, but maybe there's one you recommend?",1647354234
532,Applying for a balance transfer,0,teps5x,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/teps5x/applying_for_a_balance_transfer/,12,"I'm trying to pay off a roughly $10,000 balance on my Capital One VentureOne card (related to a car accident) by transferring the balance. However, I was turned down for a WellsFargo card with 0% APR about three months ago (even though I bank with them and was told I was preapproved, which was extremely frustrating). They cited a delinquent account and a low bank balance for why they turned me down (my bank balance is low, but it's not my only bank account, and I don't know why they assumed that).

As for the delinquent account, I checked my report and realized that I had a 10-year old collections account that had recently popped back up, that was keeping my credit score around 640. I finally cleared that up and it was removed from my report.

Now, my credit score (Experian/FICO 8) has moved up to 703. After that, I decided to wait at least 3 months before applying again, and that date is approaching next month. However, I'm terrified of getting turned down again and having to wait another 3 months, in order not to drop my score further.

The letter states that as of March 4 I owe $x amount. I paid the debt on the 10th and sent a certified letter on the 13th. 

Did I screw this up? Are they going to report this as a paid collection on my report. 

The collection agent I spoke to on the phone said they don't report because they are not the owner of the debt. That comes rom the furnished. They were just assigned the debt, they did not purchase the debt so they don't report.

A few years ago, we lived in a condominium that utilized Spectrum to provide internet. Upon moving out, we were told to leave all Spectrum-related equipment for pick up. A few months after moving out, my friend received a call from collections due to an unreturned router. Obviously, we were long gone and had no way of ever finding it.

When my friend asked the debt collector if paying the fee for the router would remove the collections, the agent told them no.

I have had credit cards now for 16 years. I have a perfect payment history and no late payments. The cards I got that long ago were the introductory cards where the interest rate is exorbitant and you often start out owing the bank money. Yet I persisted and over time, I got extensions on my limit. Payments were always on time and above the minimum. 

Right now I’m sitting on a 711 Equifax score. I have total available credit of $17,500. 

My cards are (limit/debt)
Capital One Visa $4500/$4200
Capital One MC $1300/$1100
Truist Visa $7500/$0
Guitar Center (Synchrony) $2500/$1175
Synchrony Car Care $800$30
Dental Care Credit $1000/$50

I just got the Truist card and was thinking of moving over the Capital One cards because the interest is 28%. But the banker suggested a loan instead, said I had a good score and payment history and he couldn’t see why I wouldn’t be approved. We worked it out for a 5 year/$241 payment per month. I’m currently paying between $275-$350 a month depending on how much I’m making and overtime. 

I’ve been at my job for seven years and make $42K a year and have a strong debt to income ratio, and my CC utilization is only 38%. 

I know individuals with less income, shorter credit histories, lower scores, and late payments that were able to get installment loans. So I don’t get why I was declined.

The guy at the bank said the reason given was that I had too much credit card debt. Well duh. I agree that it’s too much which is why I wanted to consolidate. I’m fully capable of making the loan payments. My history shows that I can manage my debt.

The banker says I should just do the balance transfer for the Capital One cards and pay them down so it tot debt is under $5000. Fine. But I still don’t understand why I’m such a bad risk with everything I have in my favor. It’s a little insulting.",1647291013
541,So frustrated,2,tedi9j,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tedi9j/so_frustrated/,8,"Hi everyone. Until recently, my credit had been over 800 for as long as I can remember. I had never missed a payment and I hdlad never had a balance.

Several months ago, I had a ""Bank A"" credit card that was affiliated with a company. The card had solid benefits and I had it for many years. I always paid in full every month and never have had a balance on any card I own. 

Bank A ended its affiliation with the company and ""Bank B"" took over the card. I never activated the Bank B card because the benefits changed. I also moved to a different town at around the same time. 

I eventually received a forwarded bill from Bank B to my new address with a notice that the payment was late. It was nominal amount (under $30) and I called and paid it, explaining that I had moved and didn't even know I owed Bank B anything. 

A week or two later, I got a notice from my local bank that my credit score had dropped due to the 30 day late notice that Bank B put on my credit report. From over 800, it went down to the low 600s! (This number is from a Chase service called Credit Journey, which I believe is a FICO score.) The score went up after Bank B reported that I paid the past due amount, but it's still almost 100 points lower than it was (and I believe still should be).

Here's the kicker. With the benefits I had accrued from the card, Bank B actually owed me a multiple of what I owed them! (And they still haven't paid me.)

I wrote Bank B and explained the situation. They refused to change the report. I disputed it with Experian, but Bank B again refused to change it. I don't know what to do next, so thought I'd ask here. Thanks very much for any advice!",1647308349

So +40 points (and a lower interest rate) when I haven't done jack shit.  Add in 8k of my own money I have spent to pay off balances this month and the simulator says I will go up a net of +85 points, from 676 to 761.

Credit is weird.  I hope the simulator's correct but this is just strange.  Big picture wise, as they see it, I'm up to my eyeballs in credit card debt with 92% utilization/31k outstanding, and I pay in a lousy 8k of my own money (and 15k borrowed) and now I'm a sterling citizen worthy of a major loan???!

I have the capital one credit stimulator and it said that if I Pay off my credit card in full and close it my credit score will go down.

The credit card that I have isn’t the best it has an annual fee and I just think that I would like to apply for a different credit card and pay off the one I have now.

I called them almost exactly 11 months after I was seen and spoke to their rep, giving them all of the correct insurance information to bill them correctly. I was assured they would bill my insurance, and that was that. Fast forward over a month later, they still had not billed my insurance. This unfortunately meant that they no longer met the 12-month billing requirement to have it covered under my insurance. My insurance says they can't do anything for me.

Two questions about [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) and then follow up questions.

I'm wanting to increase my credit. And I don't want to sign up for these other predatory type of credit card companies.

1. For [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) can I have a 0 balance on this account and it still report the $1500 credit line to the 3 bureaus as long as I don't close the account? Or is this like a secured card I need to always have a balance in there for the card to be active?
2. If I open the account what happens to my age of history and if I close this account what happens to my age of history?

Are there companies similar to [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) or cards that I can use that don't do a hard inquiry and have no annual fees or MONTHLY fees? Credit One and First Premier have both of these issues.

My worry is I currently have 10 years age of history. If I start getting a few of these cards and I want to wean off of them in the future when I start getting better card offers how will this affect my age of history for my accounts?

I'm also wondering if [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) is known by creditors as a type of ""hack"" and could this hurt me in anyway if lenders knew what [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) was. ",1647172963

I never made any payments, since I felt I shouldn't have owed it, due to having to withdraw due to circumstances outsi6of my control.

I did some research because I wasn't certain of what year it was for when I saw it on my credit report, but did confirm that it was for the fall of 2014, and my college also confirmed the due date for payment was August 1st, 2014.

I tried disputing it through requesting verification of dates or whatever on Experian (figured I would start with just them and plan a different tact with the others depending on the results), and within a day or two, it was supposedly verified as accurate. 

I then basically just disputed it again, but on all 3 agencies (which still apparently is not complete). I attached a screenshot of the email I received from my college stating what was said above. I know that's probably not a binding document, but it was all I could get - they sent correspondence in the mail, but after so long, I couldn't wait to at least try.

I had emailed my college and was clear about why I was disputing, and they said they would forward my communication to the collection agency and have them reach out to me, send something to me, etc.

Then the very next day, I notice the collection doesn't appear to be showing up anymore on either TransUnion or Equifax -- it was never on Experian, so I'm now showing 0 collections suddenly, across the the board. 

So, I guess my question is, is it possible for a collection to just temporarily disappear while in dispute? Or did the collection agency just realize their error and stealthily remove it? I know you can't say the latter for sure, but I won't even have time to call them until Wednesday or Thursday at the earliest, with my work schedule.

Made some foolish decisions years ago after having an emergency surgery and using my CC to stay afloat after losing my employment due to the recovery time that are costing me at the moment. I am in a good financial place and would like to be more responsible moving forward. We currently rent an apartment in NYC and want to purchase a home in a rural area so our son has a backyard to play in and does not grow up in the inner city.

Credit Cards:

• Discover IT - Account in good standing, opened in 2018, have not missed any payments. Balance currently $0.

• Capital One Secured - Account in good standing, opened 2018, 4 late payments worst is 60-89 days late.

• Chase Freedom Unlimited - Account was closed in February 2020, opened July 2018, 8 times late worst payment 120-180 days late. I have regularly been making on time payments that have been reported to the bureaus. I've had over 12 on time payments since it was closed.

• Capital One Quicksilver - Account closed on September 2019, opened May 2017, this account was charged off, credit report does not show any payment history, just that it was charged off and the full balance is owed. I know this account was sold to a recovery company but that has not shown on any report.

Collections:

• Two medical bills for an emergency surgery I had in 2018, collections accounts where opened in 2019. I have disputed the information but was unsuccessful.

• I paid off two collections for the same time period, they were low amounts, and the two were updated to paid in full status.

Student Loans:

• I have an open account that has over 36 on time payments, no late payments.

Other Loans:

• I have a current Auto Loan since May 2021 no late payments

• My old Auto Loan had a 4 late payments reported.

Current Scores:

Fico 8: 545, 592, 562

Fico 5, 4 ,2: 519, 507, 545

These scores are from 2/24/22, I have dropped cc usage from 87% to 0%, and paid off the two collections mentioned above after those scores where generated so I will update the scores once they refresh at the end of the month.

I remember labcorp calling me at one point telling me I had an outstanding balance, and I specifically told them that would be impossible because I paid with insurance and I was a student and I couldn’t really afford to pay however much it was, yet I asked, and they refused to disclose the amount over the phone and said they’d take it up with the billing department. I called them like 3 times and it was the same thing over and over again. They never called me back. The only thing is, is that I am not part of that insurance anymore and I have no idea where my old card is. I also am young so I don’t have any history of credit. I also never got anything in the mail that had to do to this or any phone calls after I called them multiple times so I guess they sent it off to collections. What do I do now?",1647110857

So to keep this as short as possible, I had an exemplary credit history for 8 years or so until 2017, lot of great cards i kept in perfect standing, mortgage cars, etc. When I maxed out like 65k worth of credit cards and eventually opted to just not pay them until a point when I could settle.

Anyways, I just looked at all 3 credit scores I have and am wondering why I can't see my CC settlements on them? I remember hearing they stayed on there for 7 years, would it be a credit score that stays around on, or is there some other info lenders can see besides the 3 major bureaus?

And should I just pick the one with no yearly fee? 

Credit score in the last four months went from 646 to 696(Credit Karma) and up from 646 to 810(Experian) also should I ask for an increase in my CL for the Capital one at 1,000 or is it to early since this month will be my five months on owning that card even though my credit score jumped so high. 

Last question is just using those two apps enough to follow my credit? I know experian and credit karma follow different branches I guess of credit history. Should I have another app to follow the third bureau or does it matter and those will be enough.

Mobile user. I am turning 31 in May and hope to try for my first child when I am 33 (2024). I have several big financial goals that I would like to accomplish or get as close to accomplishing before I start family planning more seriously. If all were to go according to plan, that gives me 2 years to complete these. 

1. Purchasing a home: ideally, I would like I start this process sooner rather than later. Mortgages take a long time to pay off. I was considering house hacking for a bit before the baby comes, and that would only really be helpful if I purchased soon. I live in Texas and houses here are generally 300K+. My city has a first time home buyer's down payment assistance program. Long story short: I would qualify for this assistance on my own, but not with my bf's added income. So I was considering purchasing the house on my own. However, while my income is more, his credit score is higher than mine so would probably qualify for a better loan with him added. Would it make more sense to do a conventional loan with less down so we can apply together vs purchasing with my credit alone to take advantage of the down payment assistance? I think the general advice is to wait until your credit is at 640 to get a mortgage, but I want to know what my options are as far as purchasing a home asap. Any advice for raising my credit as quickly? 

2. Bachelor's degree: this is where it gets interesting. I recently took out a personal loan of 3,800 for the first semester of school. I havent actually paid the school as enrollment is wrapping up now. However, now I am questioning if I should have waited to take out this 3,800 personal loan until after I got the mortgage. My plan is to pay off the 3,800 over the next 6 months, then get another 3,800 loan to finish out the degree plan. I'm just realizing that this plan will likely impact my ability to qualify for a mortgage. Should I simply pay off this personal loan right away, get the mortgage, then start school afterwards? Or is it too late since there is now a new account on my credit report? If I had to choose one or the other, I'd probably choose to purchase the home before the degree. We are also planning to get married, but both dont want to have a wedding. So no huge financial burden there. 

My credit score: 593
My yearly gross income: 42,000
Student loans in default: 15,000 (am planning to start payment plan within next few months)
Credit optimization:  24% and working on getting it lower

Bf's credit score: 717
Bf's yearly gross income: 33,000
Has a car payment, but no other debts that I know of
We currently rent together

AmEx does an initial inquiry if it's your first card, often none after that and no reporting.  Chase will pull your personal credit for each business card applied for, but not report.  

Other banks (e.g: Capital One) both pull personal reports and report to personal reports.  I'm not really in the market for C1 or similar behaving business cards.

Also, building a business credit score/report via vendor Net30 accounts, store-specific business cards (Lowes, Home Depot), etc clearly don't report to personal reports, as that's how you build a D&B score, Business Experian, etc.

###My question is...

...when you apply for a personal mortgage, car loan, or other financing through AmEx, Chase, or other lender *that you have a business card through*, will they add that data into consideration, or would they strictly go off your Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion credit files...which may have inquiries, but don't show the accounts?

618,Regarding removal of consecutive charge-offs,1,tbz5tl,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tbz5tl/regarding_removal_of_consecutive_chargeoffs/,2,"Crazy story. On August 2021, I got my first car lease through a broker who made the lease agreement with Volvo Car Financial Services, and thought that I had established auto-pay for paying everything off monthly. Indeed, my credit score shows that the first payment was paid in full.

That month, I was also unfortunately the victim of identity theft, and my paranoia led to me completely ignoring any unrecognized phone numbers.

Fast-forward to about a month ago. I was completely unaware of what had been happening, and eventually ended up picking a Volvo phone call telling me my car has been marked for repossession the past 3 months, and that the account has been closed. Even though I could easily pay the loan, I could not easily afford to pay the whole car amount.

Luckily, the car was never repossessed, and I was able to work with my broker to settle the payment internally. However, now I have 3 late payments, and 3 consecutive charge-offs marked on my credit report (6 negative months in total).

Is having 3 charge-offs marked on my account correct? Should it not just be 1?

My main question is what steps I can take to try and get this all removed? This was all ignorance on my part not knowing I hadn't been paying off my loan. It's also frustrating because during this whole time, I received absolutely no emails from them, and Volvo caller IDs are purposely marked unknown for some reason. The funny thing is they started calling WAY more once I had finally picked up. They also do not even support emails, only faxes. It was just such a traumatizing experience altogether.

I know everyone in this sub recommends figuring out how to place removals on your own, but I wouldn't mind paying someone or a service either.

What would you do?

I relocated to a small city for work about 5 years ago and decide to rent (not buy) a place to live as I did not expect to live here long (covid turned my 3 year max tenure into a 5 year tenure). About 2 years into my stay I was gifted a puppy (ok, more like he was thrust upon me, but he's been great) who needed a yard so I decided to end my lease and find a home instead. Two days prior to my move [it snowed in Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9317,_2021_North_American_winter_storm#Central_and_Southern_Plains) pretty badly which caused a huge backlog with my movers. Through tough negotiation and pleading with the moving company they were able to get to me a few days after the snow cleared up and due to the timing I had to reach out to the leasing office to let them know that I would need an extra day due to everything that happened. However, due to said weather they were not in office into the day of the move and but luckily I was able to get their approval for the extension (I even got it in writing). Fast Forward roughly 6 months and a collection agency reaches out to me stating I owe the equivalent of one month's rent and they are uncompromising when I try to engage them and explain how that's not true. They stated because I stayed an additional day in the property I was liable for the entire month's rent. When I provide my payment history and any supporting documentation (including the leasing offices approval)  they just provide a standard lease agreement with my name on it (no signature or endorsement) as their proof that I owe the debt. When I engaged the CRA for support they just initiated a standard dispute in which that same piece of paper was provided and then they certified it as valid. I'm very frustrated as I have a perfect pay history and no account on my credit report has ever been late (open or closed). This might be another reason why they are being uncompromising to me as they know how important having good credit is to me.

&#x200B;

So my question is, should I just pay the money and have the collections deleted? Hiring a lawyer for a debt so small just seems ludicrous and there's no guarantee it will be removed (my family attorney who charges $350 an hour told me he could look into it for me and would charge me in increments of 15 minutes instead of by the hour, but that's still not a guarantee).",1646979905

This quite a lengthy post so thank you if you actually get through it!
So I maxed out an Amazon credit card during the pandemic that I used to pay bills and get by until the restaurant I work at opened back up. I quickly got behind on the payments and thought I was screwed until chase, who I already bank with, offered to buy out the card and in turn I would take out a 60 month loan with interest and pay it off in installments on auto draft. For 6 months I noticed the $59 go out of my account and soon forgot about it thinking it would take care of itself until I could make larger payments and take care of it. Yesterday I get a notification on my credit karma app that informs me I have taken a 77 point hit on my credit for lack of payment on that loan. I quickly call chase who directs me to their credit bureau where I’m told that I missed payments for February and march and that there was nothing he could do to help with the credit hit even if I squared up the payments with him. He also told me they had sent out a letter but made no attempt to reach me by phone or email. I had assumed that my account was delinquent on the first of both those months because of rent and that was the reason that the payment wasn’t auto drafted but after reviewing my statements I found that I had had enough money every month ready to be withdrawn. I also found that an auto draft had been made in December(2021) and February but not January or march, even though on the first of both months I had sufficient funds in my account. I called my local chase to see if they would help but the gentleman advised that I contact the number on the back of my Amazon card. I call the number and find out that they had an old address still associated with that card even though I had updated my chase information after moving the time before my most recent move( feb. 22) we clear that up and then talk about my auto draft date and change that to the middle of the month as well as pay up on the outstanding balance on the account. He then transfers me back to the credit bureau to talk about my credit hit and to see if this simple mistake can be resolved. I tell the man that I was on auto draft payments but for whatever reason the payments weren’t drafted even though I had sufficient funds in my account, he then told me that I am on manual payments and that it was clearly my fault that a payment wasn’t made. I tell him all over again that the account was in auto draft and he clearly doesn’t believe me and that the only option I have is to fax their correspondence department with a cover sheet and documentation that will take over two weeks to even get reviewed. Obviously angry and discouraged I’m just wondering if anyones been through anything similar and if this fight is even worth it. I should also note that in the first phone call I was told I could make payments through my chase app but could not find where after the call had ended. When my account was open there was my credit card section under my checking and savings account but the Amazon card account disappeared as soon as I began their liquidation program. It seems like a simple mistake on their end but they refuse to take responsibility and the hit on my credit was larger than the actual payment..Thank you in advance for feedback",1647018444

I’ve been trying to get my credit out of the gutter after some mistakes made long ago. I have everything paid off. In late January of this year I answered a call of a collection agency that had been calling non-stop for the past two weeks. I was told this was for a medical bill in October of 2016 and they sent me a written notice. I explained I did not recall that bill (at the time I did not, now I realized what it was for) and I never received a notice from them. The address they gave me was one I had not lived in since October of 2016.

Edit: Upon speaking to them they stated the following (I did record the call)
They sent a notice mid-October 2021 to my apartment in a different state that I moved out of October 31st 2016.
They received that notice back as returned on in late October 2021. They stated they did not attempt to send me anymore notices.
They reported it to the credit bureaus late January 2022 (exactly 90 days after the notice was sent back to them) I asked for a full debt verification letter and they said they will send it within 30 days. This sounds like I should be able to dispute this to me.

~~They managed to find my current phone number which is attached to my current address, but they sent the letter to an old address.~~

I was super pissed, I said send me a notice, if you can find my phone number you also have my current address and hung up.

Three days later the account showed up on my credit report.

I haven’t had the mental strength to deal with this until now. It’s about $2000 and I want a complete written document of all that I owe, but before I call I am wondering if I can send them a letter stating that they never notified me in writing, due to the FDCA they violated my rights, etc etc.

644,The road to recovery,35,tapo6b,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tapo6b/the_road_to_recovery/,5,"I’m really excited about my progress and just wanted to somewhere to share my story. 

I’ve made LOTS of mistakes with my credit. From student loan default, to unpaid credit cards & medical bills. My FICO score was a 482 in February of last year. 

I started by paying off almost all of my 7 collection accounts (still have 2 and plan on paying them when I have some extra $) and opened a $1,000 secured CC with discover. 

I then enrolled in student loan rehabilitation and started my 9 months in Feb. Luckily the CARES act made it easy for me to rehabilitate without having to add the payment to my budget. 

My score barely budged all year. I went to 516 for a while and stayed there the majority of the year. In November when my student loans were back in good standing I still didn’t see much of an increase. 32 points was all I got. Then Discover closed my account because of paperwork they claimed I was asked to send them (never did) and I didn’t send in time. 

I was sad as hell. With a measly 548 score I had 0 credit cards, student loans that were in good standing but still show the bad history, and 2 lingering collections that I didn’t know when I could pay. I felt defeated. 

I randomly decided to see if I’d qualify for a capital one unsecured card in January. They approved me for $300 and sent it over. I use it responsibly and pay it in full every month. I didn’t know when they reported so at one point my CC use was 99% (I pay my phone bill & gas bill on it every month) — I figured out the day they reported and made sure my balance was $0. 

Today I looked and I’m at 643! My highest credit score in my entire adult life!!!!!! I’m so excited and adamant to get to the 700 club! 

Patience works! I went through a roller coaster of emotions but now that I know as long as I keep trying and being responsible I’ll get there. 

My plan is to pay off the collections, continue using my card responsibly, and stay on top of my student loans. 

If anyone has any advice on how I can keep climbing I’d love to hear it :)",1646883804

647,My Experian FIC0 8 credit score is surpassed 700 for the first time in over 2 years.,49,tadoyj,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tadoyj/my_experian_fic0_8_credit_score_is_surpassed_700/,11,"TL;DR Moral of the story is time, patience, and consistency heals wounds.

If you read post from 2 years ago, I had about $30,000 in credit card debt and 150 days late. 2 of the 3 cards were closed by the bank but no yet forwarded to collections. I had been scammed and swindled by someone close to me. I have always had a near-800 score for 15 years. At its peak, my credit score was 805; at rock bottom,  505. I tried to play off the debt as a natural disaster. It was, after all, right on the onset of COVID-19, but no one at the banks or credit bureaus would loosen their grip. As I have learned from this sub, this delinquency will stay on my credit report for 7 (and a half) years, but its impact will lessen over time.

I was scared, numb, and a 1000 different emotions flowing through me. Once I had paid off the debt, I had to find ways to rebuild credit. With the one card I left, I signed up for secured cards ""credit builders"" Grain and OpenSky with the lowest possible deposits. Grain has been great. OpenSky charges an annual fee and they nickel and dime you so I closed that just before the new annual cycle started.

As I have learned from this sub, there are many different credit scores - VantageScore, FICO 8 nuances, TransUnion this, Equifax that. I realize **Experian FICO 8 is the one true measurement for looking at credit score**. Any other score is just fluff and foam. Each month my credit score would go up a little. It was anguishing to see how little it moved up and how long the score stayed stagnant. Credit score would go up 1 point and stay there for 4 months. Go up 8 points and stay there for 3 months. Go up 6 points and stay there for 5 months, and so on. Once in a while my credit score would jump 40 points, which I assume to be a milestone or annual mark of paying off my debt.

Once I paid off my debt, I kept my one true credit card use to a bare minimum. With $6,000 credit limit, I would use it only to pay for gas. I set autopay and pay off the balance in full each month. My bill averaged $80/mo. I live in an urban suburb so I biked everywhere. I use my debit card for everything else.

So yeah, it's been about 18 months since paying off in full of this roller coaster ride. I went from 505 to 701. It's nice to see the painstaking effort has paid off, however, 700 isn't the end goal. It's simply a means that I'm still not where I am. Best not to sulk about it if you're in no immediate need for credit. I certainly wasn't. I'm lucky to be in that position. There's still a long road ahead to get back to 750+. I do hope I reach that point within the next 2 years. Maybe in 6-7 months from now I might see 730 as that is the two-year mark.

Pay your balance in full each. Use your credit card less than 3% of its limit. Rinse, repeat and tediously wait a few years.

That's it.",1646849084

To summarize, I called (NCR was how they referred to themselves) and requested they send me the documentation via USPS verifying:

1. Why they think this was my debt ($1,900+/- for a payday loan that I’m pretty sure I was already garnished for nearly two years ago.  Trying to find that paperwork as well)
2. The date the last payment was made on this account
3. Proof that they were licensed to collect in my state

The guy I spoke to wasn’t rude but verify short, but basically said “I’ll just send a demand letter to your email!”

Naturally if they are able to verify and it’s within the statute for collections I would like to settle this instead of facing a garnishment.  

My questions are:

1. How should I respond to the demand letter?
2. How long legally do I have to respond to this letter before they can take me to court?
3. What options do I have between receipt of the demand letter and my response?

Update:

I called the Macy's credit service group several times and eventually got them to remove the late payment reporting. The trick was to keep trying to explain my situation to different service reps until one was willing to help me out. If a service rep was not willing to help then I thanked them for their time and hung up. Called again and tried again with a different service rep. Keep doing it until someone sympathetic and knowledgeable of the system is willing to help you out.

Don't be discouraged.  Some reps were just not willing to help at all and even being kind of rude.  Just hang up and move onto the next one.

I'm sure that a goodwill letter would be a similar approach but the phone call was a lot faster. Also should note that note all companies do this over the phone and usually require things in writing.

Shortly after I moved out the complex was sold and I could not get in touch with the property management agency that owned it while I lived there. The complex said that they had no records of those who lived there before it was sold. The collection agency said I owed 2 weeks rent, repairs to the apt and cleaning. It was in perfect condition when I moved out.
This has affected my ability to rent an apartment as I travel for work. 
I contacted the collection and the person I spoke with said they don’t do a pay for delete. 
If I pay it it will say that in my report but I am wondering if an apartment complex will see that and be able to rent to me. When I apply they contact me and say you were denied because of this and I explain it to them but it does not help. I know that it is up to the complex and no one can give me a definitive answer but if someone has gone through this maybe they can advise.",1646863147

Wish this was something taught in schools, but credit isn’t really built to incentivize good credit. It is a model to calculate how great the risks are of a person paying you back.
It is supposed to reward those who are naturally great with their debts.

So people go off of scores wayyyyy too often. Although they are important, the info that makes that score is an area that requires more focus.

Have you ever heard, “my Experian score is 750.” That is almost a concise statement. Each credit bureau has credit models that they market to each lender depending on the needs of the lender.
If you have ever heard of “my Fico score,” you have heard of a specific credit model. 3 models off of the top of my head are the Fico Score 8 model, Fico Score 9 model and the Vantagescore 3.0 on Credit Karma.
The models are like a math equation. They are proprietary so don’t even try to guess how they work other than being responsible and having integrity when you sign promissory notes. Your credit info gets fed through these models and out comes a score. Experian, Transunion and Equifax are just companies that market these models. You could have Experian credit score of 750 with the Fico 8 and 700 with the Equifax Fico 9.
The bottom line here is, pay off your debts. (No matter is charged off or past due.) Don’t hire credit counseling companies. Just try your best to pay your bills and being a person that owns his or her promises. With time and just being a very trustworthy lendee, you’ll have a a great credit score.",1646757099

I never received any notice of these bills, nor did I know that my insurance provider in USA had not paid these bills.

The other appears in all three CRA's CRs. The original balance is < $1300 for the first one and < $700 for the second one. Both collections are past California's Statue of Limitations for debts (4 years). Later this year, both collections are due for removal from my Credit Reports.

**Preferred Outcome.** I would like to delete these collections from my credit reports. I understand that they will be deleted in a few months' time but given that it needs another few months to improve my credit score, I would like to get rid of them ASAP. What is the best way to do this? I have read posts (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/nqlj6u/how_to_deal_with_collections_complete_guide/), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/nlriu4/here_is_my_collection_validation_request_process/)) by u/charlesknowes but am unsure about a few things. Any help would be appreciated!

As detailed in the linked posts, I plan to send a letter to the Collection Agencies (CAs) for validation of debt, and another request to CRAs to validate or delete the records.

**My questions are:**

1. Can I do the second step (request CRAs to validate or delete) online? Can I send the request to the CRAs only and skip the CAs altogether?
2. In the linked post, [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/nlriu4/comment/gzkx7re/) by u/mickvain states, ""after the initial 30 day period they are under no obligation to respond  to debt validation requests in order to keep reporting the to them CRA’s."" Does it mean that there's no point or utility to request validation in my case?
3. If the CAs or CRAs provide validations or don't delete the collections, will it have any adverse outcome for me, e.g., the collections being in my CR for a longer period, instead of being removed this year?
4. How do I delete these records if they provide validations of the debt? As I was never served the debt notice, is there another way to dispute these?
5. \[Added on 03.08.2022\] I notice that the collections are updated periodically on my Credit Report (latest update on Dec 2021) and my credit score suffers after the update. Could someone please explain what these updates are, and until when this will happen? If I ask dispute these collections directly with the CRAs, will it lead to some kind of updates as well?
6. \[Added on 03.08.2022\] Just found that there's something called ""**Early Exclusion**."" Can I benefit from this? I called Trans Union today but the rep and the rep's supervisor both said they can only dispute, they don't know anything about early exclusion. Could someone please elaborate how it works?

704,Collections because of mother,13,t91yos,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/t91yos/collections_because_of_mother/,34,Hi everyone. So my mother took out a credit card in my name and ruined my credit. The credit card is closed and It has an account in collection for 350$. It’s almost been 2 years since it was opened. She said she has the paperwork to prove she paid it off and is gonna look for it. I’m looking to build up my credit because I want to move out and my score is at 524. Would I be able to take out a new credit card and build my credit while I have the collections in that closed card? I really don’t want it to get to the point where I have to report my mother for fraud even though I’m extremely upset.,1646693658
705,Disputed and removed late payment upon blocking 3rd party bureaus. Waiting to know if it will reflect once again for an ongoing auto loan.,2,t9c9y7,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/t9c9y7/disputed_and_removed_late_payment_upon_blocking/,1,"Late payments are generally one’s worst enemy when it comes to credit scores , especially if they are within one year. Even after you close out a loan, these late payment records stay up to 7 years and they still hurt your credit scores a lot. One can expect 20 to 30+ points increase upon making a late payment disappear off their credit report, if it is recent. 

After disputing directly with the creditors by sending CEO ‘goodwill’ emails , snail mails with proper documentation on why I missed out on a single 30-day late payment (medical and negligence both), and apologizing profusely - I ended up only being frustrated having wasted a ton of time. All my efforts yielded standard responses and no gain as goodwill letters / Equifax / TransUnion / Experian disputes don’t really work if the late payment is a valid one. 

Finally, before giving up altogether, I resorted to one another method that the YouTube tutorials and credit repair agencies suggested, but don’t explain a lot - because this is how they probably make money. I had also engaged LexingtonLaw and it has been an absolute waste of $40 past two months (with discounts) under their cheapest plan, and I plan on discontinuing them anyways. I went ahead and blocked / froze / opted-out ( google search name followed by opt-out ) SageStream , LexisNexis , ARS (Advanced Resolution Services) , Innovis , and CoreLogic third party credit bureaus finally after navigating through their web portals. I also had to call in using phone to block one of them and had to manually e-fill a PDF for blocking another one. Overall, I religiously provided all my addresses and names while opting out (can get this exhaustive list from a annualcreditreport.com) and this process took about 20 days. I would suggest to wait out a month before getting ready to dispute once again since the opt out process can take sometime to kick in. These companies will mail you the intent to opt out and I recommend saving all these paper mails so that you can unblock later on.

Finally, I used Equifax and TransUnion dispute centers to file disputes with a statement recognizing my CEO email and a boilerplate reply from their executive team promising to resolve this (ultimately they did state it is accurate , FCRA guidelines , but you leave out that part). To my surprise , after about 2 weeks , my Equifax has deleted this single 30-day late payment which was 3 years old. This loan was closed out long back by me, but this method certainly works. The remark I got was “ there has been a temporary freeze on my credit file “ , and since they could not verify the dispute , the late payment is now gone ( along with it also disappeared my payment history but I don’t care ). Experian is a little tricky and you can file a dispute online ( Do not recommended calling them and filing the dispute ) by using Experian.com/upload - but you would have to indicate everything manually as an attachment. I plan on doing this on another 30-day late payment from last year (This is an ongoing auto loan and I shifted apartments between the time the loan started and first payment was due, mail forwarding didn’t happen and I missed out on getting my loan number and online access set up on time though i had communicated at the start of my car purchase that I was going to move apartments). I am still curious whether all of the reporting will happen once again after the dispute goes through successful and whether my late payment from last year would reappear in my credit report or not. I am yet to find that out, but my journey of 3 months did end up being fruitful and stressful - all for missing two 30-day payments! Never miss payments! Collections affect your report more , but also can be removed easily. Late payments are really tough to fight against !!",1646728058

Background: going through a separation and soon to be divorced. 26 Male in Michigan. We had a house that we owned together and just sold. So thanks to the market we more than doubled our money. After splitting our equity I paid off all of my old credit card debt, my car, and put a down payment on my own place. It was roughly 15,000 in debt. I Bought a trailer in a mobile home park near my work. My credit was below a 600 to start. After just doing that it shot up to around 650 according to credit Karma, but it seems to be plateauing. I’m assuming/hoping my mortgage on my trailer will still count the same and eventually raise my score. 

Here’s the bad. I had one missed CC payment on my personal credit card from over a year ago or so, possibly even 2 years now I can’t remember exactly. And before my wife left I co-signed on a Credit Card with her (not knowing this was gonna happen of course) that she failed to make at least a few payments on once she was on her own and didn’t have my income to support her. I know that one is paid off now because I asked her to pay it off and close it. Which she proved to me she did but I’m sure the negative remarks are still there for both of us. 

So now I’m wondering what is the best way to improve my credit score from here. My goal is to finance a new motorcycle by this Summer after the divorce is finalized to try and distract myself (she left me). Call it my “Divorced Life Crisis” lol. I more than have the monthly income to support it, especially after downsizing my home payment and no longer having a car payment. Honestly this divorce was the best thing to happen to me financially so I’m trying to be glass half full. Even if she comes after me for child support (which she claimed she won’t but we’ll see) she wouldn’t get much. She works full time and doesn’t make that much less than I do hourly rate wise. And we do 50/50 week on week off with my daughter. We were also married less than 3 years. Still get along decent for what it’s worth as well. 

Is it best to use my current credit card (Navy Federal Credit Union Cashback card) in small amounts and pay it off shortly after? Maybe Apply for a different one? I have had this card for about 4 years now. 

Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Thanks all!",1646693164

The last time I checked 6 months ago the scores were around 790-800.

The scores gradually came up over time but then plateaud around the 800 level. I think they had been at 800 for at least 3 years prior to jumping up to 850.

I think the reason I was able to get to 850 was because of 2 factors that I wasn't doing before until recently:

1. I added a ""diversity"" of debt. When my score was hovering around 800 I had student loan and credit card debt but that was it. In the last year I got a car loan and a house mortgage. I think that diversifying my loan debt gave me a bump.
2. For years I carried zero credit card debt. However in the last few months I made it a point to make small purchases on credit cards periodically, no more than 5% of my total credit limit. Actually using my credit cards instead of just carrying a zero balance forever helped.

For those of you struggling, keep your head up. 8 years ago I had multiple late payments on my credit cards and my scores were in the low 600 range. Never declared bankruptcy but always assumed that my credit would be permanently damaged from it.",1646548993

First time posting here . 
A little background, back in 2015 I got a new job and unfortunately I didn’t get an actually paycheck till 2 months later . During that time I was in training. (Airline.) 
I didn’t think much of my credit score so I fell behind on credit card payments and just didn’t pay them . My score tanked to 500s !

Foolish I know but now 7 years later my credit debt is paid off and all 3 of my scores are 715,720 and 724. Super proud of myself . 

Question now is I have late payments on my report, 30/60/90 days and later this year will be 7 years exactly . 

My understanding is they fall off in our credit report at this time . 
How much more of an improvement could I expect ? Really want to get to 800.

If I have zero utilization, how much impact does available credit have on my score?  How much worse off would I be with 0% utilization on $16,000 versus $30,000?

I have a bank card (Citi/Costco) and two store cards (IKEA and Dell) with combined credit limits of $16,000.  All are at a zero balance.

After a divorce in 2020, ex and I still have a a joint credit card with USAA.  Limit is $14,000.  Current balance is zero.  Ex and I agreed to leave that card open with zero balance to help both of our credit scores while she refinanced the former marital residence, and I bought a house.

Refi is done, so I'm looking to buy soon. My question is, what would be the impact to my scores of closing the joint account now?  I'd have a lower limit and thinner file, I know, but how much might that move the needle?

I trust my ex not to max out the USAA card, but closing sooner rather than later eliminates that risk entirely.  Also, I plan to use the Citi card to churn a few hundred dollars each month, but not carry a balance.  Even with a $16k aggregate limit I'll keep utilization below 5%.

- AMEX card: charged off. $4k. 12 late payments (do they remove late payments if you pay the account in full?)
- Kohl’s charge: $3k. 4 late payments. charged off. 
- Comenity: $4k. 8 late payments. charged off. 
- 1 account in collections from credit one. $1k. haven’t checked if they can pay to delete yet. 

What’s the best/worst case scenario for my credit score and mortgage approval? By the time I apply for a loan in late Sept. I will have $0 in debt and approx $50k saved for a down payment.

Editing to add:
I have $0 in student loans, paid that off. It seems like the only thing holding me back is the debt & late payments. Kohls and comenity will not pay to delete, but AMEX might, I haven’t had the chance to speak with them because the hold times were too long. What looks best on my loan application?

Within a week or so after accepting the Cap One secured card I went with the Chime Credit Builder card. I let those age a bit for roughly 2-3 months.

Only my Equifax background shows the credit limit witch is $3000.00. Kick off gave me $500.00 in ""bs"" non-usable credit. Along with that it charges you $24.00 to be prayed back over the course of a year. So that's $2.00 a month. The Petal card is backed by Web-Bank and takes other factors into account other than just a score. Such as income and cash on hand. Pedal gave me a $500.00 limit as well as 1% back on all purchases.

Here is my scenario. I have a Capital One Quicksilver Card (my very first) alongside an Amazon Prime Rewards Visa. Given that there are 2% general cashback cards, I was looking to replace the Quicksilver, but I decided not to because I do not want to close my oldest card with only two in total.

However, I then learned three things:

1. I was preapproved for a Capital One Savor One card, which seems to be a solid third card given most of my general spending is on groceries or dining out.
2. I am able to exchange the Quicksilver card for a Venture One card
3. You can convert points from a cashback card (like the Savor) into miles on the Venture

Given this information, I am tempted to change my Quicksilver into a Venture, use the Savor for most of my general spending (groceries/dining), and then later apply for a 2% cashback card for general spending. This seems like a solid plan from my perspective, but what does everyone else think?",1646511593

The $20k is mostly high-interest credit cards. No good reason other than an overly casual approach to my finances. So I'm finally getting serious with myself. I have a snowball/avalance calculator showing that I will pay this off by June or July 2023. But I'd like to move cash over to pay down this debt more quickly.

I owe: about $17K to high-interest credit cards (the 20% variety)

and $2700 on a zero interest balance transfer card with about $3K in remaining credit

I have a monthly cash flow of about $8000. House and car are owned free and clear.

I also have about $5000 in an emergency fund, another $5000 in low-interest accounts, and about $1500 in reserves in my bill payer account.  I also have about $26K in equities in a non-retirement account. Should I deplete these funds to pay down the debt? Do a balance transfer into the zero interest card?

Ideas? Will this be enough to raise my credit score ~~above 715 ?~~   above 750. May want to buy a car in a year or two.

Does anyone know what this means? I settled a debt with a law firm (I was being sued) for $5400 on $8200 this past week. The money came out of my account. Law firm confirmed it was closed and they were going to notify the court so the judgement was stopped, etc.

It's been three days. Each day they say they are going to send me an email with the form they are sending the court and each day they do not. Then they there was a delay due to staffing, etc. Today they they told me the account was closed but ""on hold"" and when I pushed further said ""under review"" and to call back next week. Maybe the status would change, maybe it wouldn't.

The day after I paid my sixth statement, I got upgraded from $400 to $1800 with an invite to pick a new color.  
  
This sub is incredible. From a subprime borrower to a middle FICO 8 of 717, lowest FICO 691 and climbing and three unsecured cards. I still need to save up for my down payment to realize my dream of buying a home (have 3% but in a competitive market) but the credit situation makes it much easier to get money back with Amazon, gas, groceries.  
  
Best tips: be human to the collection agencies, they’re just employees and unless they’re jerks to you there’s no reason to treat them like dirt. Be clear about how much you’re willing to spend. Worst they can say is no. Never acknowledge debt or make a promise to pay it back fully. Use terms like “can we negotiate what I’d have to pay **to get this off my report**” and not “to pay what I owe”.  
  
My app favorites: Credit Karma for alerts, Experian for free FICO 8, Credit.com for free Experian VS 3.0. Personally I paid for the MyFICO but it’s expensive. Experian has a three bureau score for much cheaper. Discover, Capital One, SDFCU and American Express also have free credit reports/scores.",1646360815

My husband has two outstanding debts from his previous marriage totaling $15k that have been charged off but still with original creditor. We paid off most of my outstanding debt with just one left that's $3k that's also charged off and still with the original creditor.

We went through a rough patch and settled on all of our credit cards. We have a car loan listed as current under both of our names and student loans listed as current under my husband's name.

Our goal is to buy a house, but we need to lower our debt to income ratio and raise our middle credit scores to at least a 620 to go FHA/Conventional or 640 to go USDA.

Yesterday, we were advised by a lender that we shouldn't pay a lump sum on the charged off credit cards (DOFD: 6/2018) because it'll tank our credit scores, but we should make payments on them. 

Today, the same lender told us we shouldn't settle the cards at all because they're charge offs.

We ran a simulator on MyFICO, and it showed that if we paid the debt off, my husband's scores should go up tremendously.

The process of paying off my debt and repairing my credit after years of neglect. I have two credit cards that were closed/cancelled (they report differently depending on the agency) by the creditor due to being some 150 days past due at one point. Luckily, it was never reported as a charge off or went to a collections agency. The accounts are currently in good standing and reporting as “paid or paying as agreed”, but I still hold a balance and have been paying off for years.

At this point, I’ve gotten my finances in a good place and have a bit of extra cash that I plan to use to pay off these old cards. My question is, is there a way to negotiate with the credit card company for a lesser amount, much like you would a collections agency? If there is, will settling the account in this way have less of a positive impact on my credit report than if I were to pay the entire remaining balance?

I know this is a truly terrible time to buy but I have a super old car 15 years that has done well for me but it has died 4 times in 2 weeks and fixing it isn't worth the money I'll have to put in to it. Unfortunately, I got hit by the pandemic and was unemployed and ran up about 28k in credit card debt last year. This was irresponsible but I bought like food and paid bills not lavish spending or anything so it is what it is.

Either way, I'm ready to pay it off and be done with credit card debt. Currently the credit cards are at about 23% apr. Ouch. 


Currently making 130-140k.
Fico Score 650. 
Mortgage 2400 
Credit cards about 1000
Student loans 300

10k emergency fund can use some of that for car down payment.

I got a personal loan pre-approval offer for 12.9% on 35k. it's enough to pay off all the loans and add a tiny bit to my emergency fund for my sanity.

Currently, it is impossible to find a reasonable reliable old car. I need a 3rd row SUV because of work and family size. I'm looking at 2022 to 2019s And the prices are all ridiculous. 40 to 50k for something reliable. Carvana pre-approved me for a 7.79 rate on one that was 44k. Monthly payment about 800 dollars. I can pay it but it all feels insane. But when I go lower in price I'm looking at cars with 80-90k 100k miles and God knows what other problems. For 20 to 30k...

Just opened an account at a credit union and am considering seeing what I can get through them for an auto loan but I'm scared for my credit to take the hit from the hard inquiry. 

So basically... WTF should I do? Should I take the personal loan first pay off my credit cards and try to see if I can get my credit up a bit more in the next 2 or 3 months before my car does for good?Will the Microchip shortage be over?  Or should I just take a car loan and just pay off the credit cards at the higher apr rate? Or some other option?

843,Should I pay off my charged-off Cap1 auto loan? Details in post…,1,t601a9,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/t601a9/should_i_pay_off_my_chargedoff_cap1_auto_loan/,9,"Took out a Cap1 auto loan back in August 2014 for around $12,100. Went back to school full-time in 2015 to complete my undergrad degree but I wasn’t working at the time, so ended up doing a “pro-active” repossession if you will. Advised Cap1 I was a full-time student with no income and I could no longer pay my car note.

Last payment posted was in September 2016. As of March 2022 my account has never gone to collections, but occasionally Cap1 will send me a letter or email encouraging me to settle the account for significantly less that what’s owed or pay it in full.

Does it makes sense to pay it off either in full or partially or wait for it to fall off my report next year? Details below:

• Original loan amount: $12,975
• Account opened: August 2014
• Amount paid to date: $6,839
• Amount owed: $6,136
• Account closed: September 2016
• Last payment date: October 2016

Partial payment amount and credit report stipulations:

Pay $771.97 (12.58%) of original balance
•Remaining balance forgiven
•Inform credit bureaus “paid in full for less than the full balance”
•Future lenders may see my prior charge off and that I paid less than what I owed.

Full payment and credit report stipulations:

Pay $6,136.78 (original balance)
•Account will be paid in full, with nothing more to owe.
•Inform the credit bureaus account is “paid in full”
•Future lenders may see my prior charge off and that I paid my account in full.

Cap1 has also given me the option to break down each payment for up to 36 months.

Additional details: I have 2 credit cards with Cap1 as well as a checking and savings account for around 3 years now. All my accounts have been in good standing which is why I believe they haven’t sent the auto loan to collections.

Want to know if it makes sense (if I’m looking to improve my credit score) to take either of the two above options and possibly write a good-will letter for removal or simply wait for it to fall off next Fall.

I'm hoping for some advice here to see if there's anyrhing I can do in my situation. I just checked my credit report and saw that a collections report has been made. I only know about the collection because it was reported to my credit, and it appears to be from a little over a year ago for some old Spectrum equipment. 


I have two problems with this charge. The first being that I thought a rep from spectrum took the equipment back when I disconnected it, and I do not have it. The second problem is I never got notice from the vendor that the equipment wasn't received, nor from the collections agency that I had an account in collections. It's a bummer because this hurt my credit and I would have done something about it if I had only known about it.


Anyways, I'm wondering if there are any options for me to hopefully recover my credit. My first instinct is to dispute the collection on the grounds that I thought someone from the vendor took the equipment back. 


However, I'm also wondering if there are any requirements for the collections agency or vendor to inform me of the debt; I reviewed my records and found no emails, phonecards, or physical letters of yhe debt from either the collections agency or yhe vendor. Are there any requirements on them to send proper notification, that I could utilize to reduce the impact to my credit, or possibly get the collections record deleted?

This isn't really a question of paying off the collection; if the vendor insists they did not receive the equipment back, I'm okay with paying off the balance. This is more of a concern of if I can get the collection removed from my credit, as I really do not want to have it on there for seven years.",1646335932

Long story short by 2020 I had roughly a remaining balance of $560 left to pay according to my student account. I no longer have access to my student account so I can not confirm the exact total, but I do have some bank statements that show that I have at least paid the university $1800. At one point, I did change banks, so I can't back track any more payments made. Back in 2021 I did reach out to my university regarding the remaining balance via email and they did acknowledge that I had been making payment to them directly but that they could not disclose my remaining balance as I have to pay whatever fee they paid to send me to collections on top of what I had left to pay.

My dilemma is that I did pay my university back the majority of the balance, so why is the collections agency asking for $3035.50? What about the roughly $2400 that I paid over the years to the school? Should I contact my university's finance department about this situation or the collections agency.

I have 3 cards. 2 that i use regularly and pay off every month. 1 is for a jewelry store that I recently paid off and will close eventually and I paid off my auto loan. 

The only debt on my credit report is my student loans.

I have 3 inquiries. 2 for recent credit card openings and 1 for an attempt to buy a house in May 2020. (We were approved but the house ended up valued under the agreed upon price and the bank wouldn’t finance so we didn’t go through with it)

My history goes back 6.5 years. I have 100% payment history and nothing every got collections outside of some small medical bills that are now paid off.

I know 740 is a good score but I want to do everything I can to get the best rate because we’re ready to buy a house within the next year.",1646242872

First time posting but I have come to love and respect the Reddit community and value the advice I see here so figured I’d give it a go. Okay so classic story, dumbass in my younger years trying to turn it around. Graduated school with no student loan debt in December and managed to land a decent job started January 3rd 2022, making around $60k a year after taxes. I am 28 and this is the first time I am making the type of money where I don’t feel like I am truly struggling to stay afloat. I have a 587 credit score. I have made all payments across the board on time for my one credit card, rent, and other bills for the past 4 years. However, while a private in the army I took my fat E-1 paycheck to a local scammer and drove away with a newish car. Payments were fine then but once I got out I could not find a job and it was repoed from my driveway in the middle of the night. Never made contact with initial loaner and it has since been moved to a new account. The value is $8,674 and was last reported on January 29, 2022. The only other open account I have is an MRI the VA was supposed to have paid for but instead went to collections totaling $623. I have ignored this also because I flat out disagree with it being my responsibility. This is the total of my debt but I also know it is holding me back, rental properties are crazy expensive right now and I think the smarter thing for me to do financially is to find use with my VA home loan. I’ve heard 580 is acceptable but have had a few places tell me they will talk to me at 620. What is y’all’s advice? My living situation is fairly untenable as it currently is. How can I raise my score over the next two months? Is that even realistic? I am humble and trying to get my shit together, so hit me with the truth stick.",1646237116

* **For a conventional home loan, it’s important to have a credit score of at least 620.** Anything lower may deliver a higher interest rate. Conventional loans have lots of other qualifications, following Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines.
* **FHA loans** are more flexible about credit scores and other qualifications. Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, **you'll need a minimum credit score of 580** and a down payment as low as 3.5%.
* **VA loans** are available to members of the military and their spouses. Insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs, many lenders require a score **between 580 and 620** and often don’t require a down payment.
* **USDA loans** are backed by the Department of Agriculture. Like VA loans, a down payment isn’t always required, although most lenders require a FICO score of **640 or higher.**
* **Jumbo loans** are typically larger than conventional loans and often look for a credit score of **at least 700** as well as a large down payment.

If you have a low credit score and are thinking about a mortgage, start working on your credit history.

1. ***Pay bills on time -*** One of the biggest factors in your credit score is your on-time payment history. Lenders want proof that you can make payments as promised and handle your debts responsibly. Your payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score.
2. ***Maintain low credit utilization*** \- Most experts recommend using no more than 30% of your available credit, across all your cards. Your credit utilization is another big factor credit bureaus use to determine your score.
3. ***Track your credit reports*** \- Check your credit reports regularly. If there are errors, file a dispute with the credit bureau and your card issuer.
4. ***Pay off debts*** \- If you're carrying debt, pay down your credit card balances. Mortgage lenders will review your debt-to-income ratio to determine if you can afford a home loan.
5. ***Keep credit open*** \- When you keep older credit cards open and active, you’re building a strong credit history (as well as lowering your credit utilization).",1646162237

This is my first post in here, and i'm looking for some guidance. I will share with you a short description of my credit repair journey. I started with a score around 500 about a year ago, and now stand around 620. This damage all happened due to being young, dumb, and irresponsible with credit cards when I was younger. I have multiple charge off's, and had about 30k in charged off credit cards. I have now paid off 26k of those, and paid off 4 of my revolving cards down to AZEO at less than 10% usage. My mortgage scores are about 10 points away from getting a preapproval for a mortgage. I'm just wondering what I can do to get a small jump in my scores. These are my 2 options, and i'm wondering which one will get me the jump I need in the next 2 weeks.

1. Pay off a collection that was and old medical bill that should've been paid thru my insurance, but the insurance company refuses to pay. The collection agency stated they would remove the collection from my report if i pay in full.
2. pay down a charge off from credit one, my limit was 400.00 and it's sitting at 750, and there reporting it to credit bureau's at 180% usage.

If I close some could it not be a good thing if my utilization is not hurt?  Have less open accounts = good I think.

That the banks are not stupid and that the store cards and those kind of loans do not impress them much… the numbers may help your credit some but they would be much more impressed by loans for the purpose of building credit that are from real financial institutions like real banks and credit unions.  Also the store cards are issued by real banks, but they are known to be easier to get.. and  tend to have low limits.  So all of those being easier to get are thought of less seriously than regular credit cards/ loans… and that ones with lower limits are thought of less seriously than those with higher limits.  Plus these ones that I don’t use are potentially taking up credit that I could get from better cards / and institutions that would in turn be thought of more highly than These other ones.. also the credit age is low on them.. but so is pretty much all of my credit age..  any thoughts?

Hey all!

Recently I just paid off $8,000 of debt (all 7 collection accounts from 2021). I called each of the collection agency's and made a settlement payment with them all and they will be sending a letter of 'paid in full"" to my address. I assume that is what will be marked on my credit report once reported. I am working really hard to buy a home by then end of this fall if I can. My credit is sitting at about 480 right now... I also have about $1,800 of all closed credit cards from the end of 2021 that I will be paying off in the next couple of days. My question is; how high do you think my score will jump with just paying off the $8,000 of collections and also how much do you think my credit will jump paying off the collections and closed credit accounts????

My current scores:

Transunion- 469

Equifax- 474

A couple of days ago I checked my credit karma and was super happy to see that my credit score had dropped to the 670s-680s overnight! 🥰 I of course tried to investigate this drop, and only two changes were found in my report. The first one was a balance increase which had increased my credit card utilization from 1% to 11%, which to my knowledge is still healthy (I thought anything under 30% is pretty good). The second one was that a “remark” had been added to my account. I honestly have no idea what this remark could be. I have tried calling my bank and they were unable to clarify. I also tried to call transunion but they were unable to give me any information over the phone, but they apparently sent me a copy of my credit report which I am still waiting to receive. I did recently have to dispute a charge with my bank because I was charged twice for a service payed for with my credit card, but my bank said this wouldn’t have contributed to the drop in score?

Since I can only get approved for credit cards with about a $350 limit is it better to have multiple credit cards with a small limit or to just have one. 

Isn't a higher credit limit better?
Or because it comes from multiple cards, will it hurt my score?
My length of accounts is already pretty recent as I didn't have much for a credit history for the last 10 years.
Also, wouldn't having 2 or 3 credit cards open with only about 50$ spent on them each month (and paid down immediately), help with my credit utilization as well?

3. 900$ charge-off wells fargo credit card

2. ON TIME PAYMENTS.
3. a mixture of loans with on time payments i have 4 positive things i'm paying one being a student loan the two being secured cards (one is chime one is discover) my auto loan and an another loan I had to take. All are being paid on time now and fit within my means

Looking for advice and just some positive outlook... I have aggressively saved and expect to pay in full if I have to for those collections, though I am doing my best to negotiate. A lot of those are old, they were in my early 20s or even when i was 18. I'm not at a point where all of this is affordable along with my daily bills but I want to know I'm doing everything I can to raise up my credit. I know it takes time but I want to make sure i'm maximizing everything I can. Should I even worry about these collections right now or should I just keep saving and focus on paying everything on time. I just thought once I had the savings I should pay those collections off but I keep hearing mixed reviews. I don't believe these can be PAY FOR DELETE. which I feel a ton of these have said to do.

Synopsis: Tanked my credit in mid twenties due to maxing out credit card for college and medical bills. used cash for Ten years with no credit cards. Figured I’d never recover and ignored using credit and what scores do. Now so much later old debts have fallen off(except one medical bill of 150$)
Since it’s been ten years no idea how credit improvement works or where to go. Just got a starter card 6months ago, always paid off on time, no benefits 1,000$ CL brought score from like 640 to 696-705 depending on what App I’m using(should I use experian or credit karma? They say two different numbers)

Down to my issue:

Big worry is my student loans are going to come off my credit history and for some reason what I’ve read means this is a bad thing? Those two loans(had for 8years)and my checking account from when I was 18 Are the only positive credit length I have and have paid on time over the years but are now under 200$ each and it comes out 50$ a month for each so that’s gonna look like two lines of credit are closing? And the only other line is the basic credit card. 
So should I go ahead and open another line of credit even though I’ve only had this credit card for a short time and a hard credit check will dump my credit temporarily. Now that I’m higher 600s I can get approved for like an Apple credit card(that actually has minor benefits over the one now which has none)or some other ones, like one which looks like a Capital One knock off called Credit One(speaking of this any card companies to just NOT go with?)and I’m worried I won’t be able to get another card to increase my utilization I guess it’s called because it was hard enough to get this card in the first place. Also how many cards should you have 2-3?

Last question was how can I upgrade my credit card. Like right now I’ve had a high interest no annual fee credit card but since my credits better how do I exchange my current card for one that has benefits. How long do I need to have the card before trying to get a better card with the same company. The only time I ever got a card was from offers in the mail so no idea how to negotiate better terms or benefits once your score increases to low/bad credit to decent credit and hopefully good credit once I hit a certain number.

• 2 credit builder loans; still paying into 1, the other 1 just completed a few days ago. 
&#10;
• 2 secured credit cards; 1 graduated me to unsecured, refunded my deposit, and increased my credit limit; the other is still partially secured, but recently gave me an unsecured credit increase

I have a $200 bill in collections I will be paying off within my next couple paychecks. A hard credit check recently fell off of my credit history, and I have 2 more hard credit checks that will be there for another year yet. 

Is there anything else I should be doing or considering for my credit? I don't make very much money and most of it is siphoned away into bills, please keep that in mind for any advice!! 

I have car repairs to do and have been wondering if it would be better for my credit to get a loan to cover the cost (so that I have another open account, since one loan just was paid off), put part of the cost on my credit card, or to save up the money for it myself. Any thoughts on that too? 

Thanks everyone!",1646062131
932,High Utilization for Feb Period,1,t3p0oz,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/t3p0oz/high_utilization_for_feb_period/,4,"Hey all,

I just had a quick question but first a little context. I found this sub months ago and have been using the tips to get started on my credit journey. I have a Discover It 
($2500), Capital One ($300), and an Apple Card ($3800). Usually I don’t spend too much on my Cap1 or Apple Card but if I do, I pay down the balance to like ≈$15 before the statement ends. The Discover is another thing though. I usually let me mom pay for her bills and stuff on it and she has been good about depositing money into my bank account so that way I can pay off most of the balance before the statement ends. 
Everything was going well until recently I had a balance of ≈$1770 and made a payment of ≈$1750 but it seems the payment didn’t clear in time.
So now it’s going to show that my balance for February was ≈$1770 and my utilization is going to skyrocket and I fear my credit score will drop as a result. I also feel a bit guilty as I have my brother and mom as authorized users so their credit scores will likely drop as well. 

So here’s my question: I’ve heard that utilization has “no memory” and as long as I get back on track next month it would be as if it never happened, is this true?",1646079992

Our credit card balance was very high those months (20k or so) but we had the cash in the bank, we were just using it for the cash back program.  We were paying off every single month, no balance.

I checked out CreditKarma and our credit score took a nosedive to 660, a 120 point drop. I zeroed out the credit cards, but it is still not back up, only having gone up 2-3 points. 

How long before we get our old credit score back? Or anything in the range? We will likely need to buy a new car in the summer and we may need to refinance my student loans, so I would hate to have an issue for such a small mistake.

I don’t believe NFCU charges a fee for transfers (I’m waiting on disclosures to come in mail so I can read fine print to be sure). My question is this…

My goal for the card would be to put all monthly expenses on there and pay in full every month. My question is… if I put the balance transfer on there, plus use it for monthly expenses, will this convert the balance transfer to a regular APR?",1646062500
