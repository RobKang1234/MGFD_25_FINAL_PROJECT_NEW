Good credit has a general formula, but it is but no means an exact science. There are many details that shouldn't be overlooked to get the best possible suggestions/feedback.

**Try to include as many of the following details as possible:**

- All accounts, cards, loans, mortgages, etc - the bad *and* the good. (Include their name as this is helpful for knowing previous strategies to deal with them.)

- Credit Limits

- Balances (Round this number - it will keep you anonymous)

- Last payment date

- Date of last delinquency (this will determine when it falls off your report)

- Date opened

- Payment status (pays as agreed, sold to collections, etc)

- Estimation of # of lates (30, 60, 90, 120+)

**Do not include any of the following:**

- Any and all personal information. You may freely share generic information (ie you have a name on your report that is not yours)

- Addresses

1,UPDATE: Getting weekly FULL credit reports has been extended through rest of 2022 at AnnualCreditReport.com,108,sih7qn,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/sih7qn/update_getting_weekly_full_credit_reports_has/,12,"## Here is the update:

## ""January 24, 2022

**Free Credit Report Offering Extended:** **TransUnion is pleased to offer you free weekly credit reports throughout 2022. This consumer benefit will continue to help people across the country manage their financial health during the ongoing hardship and economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19.""**

It is definitely worth getting your reports at least once a month during this period. If you are paying for various services, you may want to suspend that to save some money. Unfortunately this does NOT INCLUDE the key credit scores. Those are still for pay only at the usual sites or you can obtain basic FICO / Vantage scores for free at the sites listed in the sidebar.

There are several pieces of KEY INFORMATION on your official reports that are not readily available on most the typical free credit reporting sites. Notable your DOFD (date of first delinquency) and the calculated date when a negative item should be removed from your report.

FICO 8 is 600-620 depending on the bureau. Basically, I got a $15800 car loan at 13.99% in December 2021 and have had no luck refinancing, even after removing some medical collections. I got a refund for the GAP and warranty which brought it down to $10800 and then just paid an extra 800 so it's down to $10,000. It's worth $9,000. Making regular payments I'll have it paid off in 31 months. The original term was 54 months. But if I buckle down and pay very agressively I can pay it off entirely in 8 months.

Is it even worth focusing on my credit at this point? Obviously ill keep doing all the right things, but I have some major delinquencies. Most will fall off in 2023. All collections are medical accounts, and all but one are less than $500 so will be removed in July. Last late payment was January 2021, though. I've been doing fine since 2021 (had misdiagnosed mental illness before that time).

 Is it even worth focusing on credit to refinance, or should I just pay my car off as soon as possible? Thanks.

20,LVNV Court,2,tx2dye,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tx2dye/lvnv_court/,1,"Hello Everyone!

So back in 2018 I took out a credit card with Credit One. Up until August of 2019 I had some family issues which caused me to leave work. I stopped making payments on the card and it got charged off in 2020 right when COVID hit. 

I pretty much forgot about that account completely. Got my family issues solved and started my current job last March. 

So last week I got a letter from the court saying I was being sued. I had no idea what it was until I opened it and saw it had LVNV Funding on there and it mentioned my account with Credit One. I’m in Ohio near the Cleveland area so it’s 28 days to respond here. I called a lawyer to see how I could answer and the lawyer basically told me that getting a lawyer would be more than the balance I owe. I’m getting sued for $559. The lawyer said to deny the debt to buy me some time and to go from there and if I need any more help to just call him up. He gave me a template to file the answer as well 

I’m not sure how I answer them to say that. Do I just flat out say “I deny this debt” on the template he gave me, file it with the court and send it to them? On the documents I got, it basically says I owe LVNV the money. Do I need to tell them to prove to me how I owe LVNV that money and where the paperwork is at? 

I’m just confused overall on this on how to go about it. I’ll pay them but I just found it strange how they say I owe them the debt. I know they bought the debt but I want proof of it too and I’ll pay them as well. But if there’s a way to throw it all out then I’ll go that route as well, especially since I’ve never gotten any collection letters from that company before or phone calls.

My lease is up in June and I do not want to return my car. I do want to trade it in and purchase a new car from a new manufacturer. My current car company (infiniti) doesnt allow me to trade in my car to any dealership outside of infiniti (apparently its some covid thing to offset car shortage).

I noticed there was a collections account on my credit report now. I called and found out it was a medical bill from 2019. I immediately paid it off and received a letter of deletion and a letter that I paid the amount in full. They said that they will forward this information to the credit bureaus for me and I should see an updated credit score within 30-45 days. I close on my house april 25. Is there a way I can expedite the deletion of the account on my credit report in case they run my credit again before closing? 

Thanks for the help

I did. I sent them a compelling( email to the CEO's office) letter with actual documentation of what transpired ( letters from the DEO ( Florida), a letter from our Senator basically intervening on our behalf to unlock our accounts ( they were locked for 4 months so no $$$$). I sent them everything that I could think off. It worked.

24 hours later received a call from a Senior Supervisor stating that my request had been approved and the 5 late remarks were going to be removed and stated that they will be updating the info within the next couple of weeks and to be patient but we will see the update soon.

I paid off all my student loans, which dropped my score.  I then opened up my one and only credit card through my bank. It is the only type of credit I have open. I have a $2,000 limit. I use it for groceries and gas then pay it off immediately, as soon as it posts to my account.  I have NEVER had a due balance on a statement.  Since opening the credit card my score increased to just a tad over 700 in five months.    
   One month my credit utilization statement was 4%.  The next month the utilization dropped back down to 0%.  With that drop of utilization my score dropped 90 points.  Since then, the last four months, I've only been able to increase it 8 points.  My utilization continues to remain 0%.  
Now I know that Credit Karma is just a very rough ballpark but this vantage score is provided through my bank. I cannot really provide any accurate information regarding my FICO score. But I can assume that it dropped too.
  I have checked everything I can and there does not appear to be any fraud conducted.  The only thing that has changed in the past nine months of having the credit card is the 0% to 4% to 0% utilization.  I'm trying to keep my hard inquires low, so I have not planned on opening another card until this summer, when it will be a full year since my last hard inquiry.

I pay nothing.  My insurance pays everything except a $250 dollar copay, and the company that makes the medication pays the copay.  
 
My insurance always pays its portion automatically, but I have to call and tell CVS over the phone to process the remaining $250 through the drug company's assistance program, even though they have all the info on file.
 
For a while now, CVS has been sending me a letter that says I owe them 250 dollars.  
 
When I call CVS to order a refill, after ordering the refill, up I ask to speak to billing.  I tell the billing department to process my payment, which in my mind consists of the ""$250 I owe"" and the 250 I just incurred by placing the refill.    The billing department always tells me they can't process ""this month's"" charges because they haven't showed up yet, so I just pay the $250 on file and figure I will deal with this month's charges, when I call next month.
 
Moral of the story, I pay every month, even though I'm always a month behind.  This isn't because I don't have the money, as it doesn't even come out of my pocket.  This is just a bug from CVS's billing system where charges incurred don't show up right away.
 
Today I got a letter in the mail saying my account was sent to collections over a $250 charge.  
 
The only way I could be behind months on a payment is if instead of paying off the previous month's balance, CVS was setting my payment up to cover the current month and allowing the unpaid $250 to get older and older every month.  I was always under the impression that the charges I were paying were from the previous month, and that it wasn't possible to pay off ""today's charges"" ""today.""  But it seems like CVS has been charging me for the current month's charges and just rolling over my debt from the previous months, even though I wasn't aware of that.
 
I'm going to call CVS Specialty this morning, but wanted to ask here as well, is there anything I should be aware of that might help me in dealing with this?

Back in 2019 I applied for a Citi secured card for $200 to start building my credit up, and was approved. (Never missed a payment up until this)

Long story short, my old power company created two accounts for the same address and passed the unpaid “final bill” from the second account on to collections.

For a longer version: 

So to begin, I lived in a certain apartment between May and September of 2020. It was intended to be a long term lease, but I was forced to move to another nearby (US) city due to a natural disaster, and did not forward my mail because I only lived there for a few months.

I haven’t thought about this apartment in nearly two years. In January 2022, I received a call from that power company indicating I had a ~$40 outstanding balance on my account. After verifying that it was a legitimate charge, I paid it and the representative said I was all clear. Bank statements reflect the payment, and I received a confirmation email. I requested a written confirmation, but they said that since I had signed up for paperless billing, they couldn’t send anything to me without forwarding me through a different department, so I just let it be thinking nothing would come of it.

On March 30, I received a notice from a collections company, indicating that I had been turned over to collections for the same amount. 

I called the electric company and spent about an hour on the phone with them while they tried to find proof that I had paid. At first they denied that I had paid at all, but when I produced my payment verification information from the confirmation email they sent, they agreed to look further. 

As it turns out, they had opened two different accounts for the same address. One account was billed for the first three months of service, and the other was billed for the last two months. The representatives were not sure why they had done this, and told me it was not their normal policy to operate two accounts at the same address. They told me to call back the next day for more information, so I did and their credit department confirmed that this was not standard procedure for them to open two accounts like that, and that I should have only been billed for one account. I asked for this in writing and they said they would get back to me with something in writing.

I am wondering if I should just pay the debt collectors over such a small amount. I work a high stress job and worrying about this hasn’t helped me sleep any better. That said, the company also gave me until May to dispute the claim before they begin collecting, and I have a fair amount of documentation now showing that the power company created two accounts.

Should I dispute the debt now that I know it is based on an inappropriate charge? What can I expect if I do this? How can I minimize the effect on my credit or get any credit hits reversed?

Tl;dr: Debt collectors allege that I owe money from two years ago. 
Found out company they acquired the debt messed up in billing resulting in two accounts under my name. Wondering if its even worth it to dispute.",1649123242.0

December 2021   738

March 2022          738

Apri 2022              After all lates removed  798   BOOM.

&#x200B;

I'm sharing the details for data points.

Not much credit activity except student loans, and couple of CC.  Initially the Ann Taylor CC and multiple lates, 30,60,120... balance was low but had about 6\~7 lates.. Wrote a good will letter 1-2 years ago and 60,120 serious lates got removed. received a letter from Ann Taylor after good will ( Comenity Bank ). 60,90 days lates removed.

The account got closed due to inactivty. With 3 30 day lates.  I thought the all lates got removed with Goodwill, but when I called Comenity, they could not pull up records. ( no records)   Filed Online dispute with Experian. the other two are in the works.  All lates got removed.

&#x200B;

Lessons

My CC#1 has 93% utilization (oldest)

My CC#2 has 47% utilization

My CC#3 has 12% utilization

My CC#4 has 2% utilization

I do not have any derogatory items. I've recently requested credit increases on all my cards (to avoid a hard inquiry) and been extended the credit line increases. They were not significant increases but nonetheless helped to lower my utilization.

**1: Will applying and getting a new CC simply for balance transfer a wise idea? How significant will the impact be on my score considering the ""hard inquiry"" and lowering the avg age of my accounts?  I don't plan to use the new CC for anything else but balance transfer and paydown.**

My credit score was 776 and now it’s 706. Two weeks ago I disputed a charge on my credit card because a crooked kayaking tour business where I went on vacation to did not reimburse me my money after I canceled the tour following their cancellation policy. I should be reimbursed! As soon as the charge was posted on my statement I called Chase Bank to dispute. Yesterday, I got an email from Experian saying my credit score decreased. I logged in and my credit score dropped by 70 points!!! What is going on?! If I knew a lousy dispute would cause this, I would have never created it despite the fact that I have every right to do so. 

I did a simple Google search and supposedly when a comment about a dispute is placed on an account, that account will temporarily not be reflected on your credit report until the dispute is resolved and therefore your credit score may drop or increase temporarily depending if your account was in good or bad shape. Am I getting that right?

Anyways, I’m trying to buy a home this year and supposedly mortgage lenders won’t even touch you if you have an “Account in dispute reported by subscriber (FCBA)” comment on an account because they know that your credit score could be artificially inflated… which I heard it can be difficult to remove such a comment even when calling or writing to all 3 credit bureaus.

I was young, foolish, and ""didn't care about my credit"" but I'm trying to get my credit on track. A few negative marks came from COVID, I lost my job and was denied unemployment three times due to the company finding a loophole in our contracts. Also had a child during covid, and becoming a single parent financially strained me even worse.

If I don't format this right I'll update it just let me know! 


The bad - 
1. Amex charge off, DOFD is March of 2017. It's been reported as ""CO"" since August of 2018. Originally I got this because my score was 700+ and credit card companies were throwing cards at me. Had to charge about 10k over the course of a few months to this card because I had a dog that needed multiple surgeries. Payment became unmanageable for 22 year old me. 
Past due: about 8k


2. Auto loan, DOFD is November of 2017. I tried to work with the bank about the payment but they weren't willing to work with me. Couldn't make the payment because of the previously mentioned credit card. I told them to please take the car back (lol 😅) because I couldn't make payments on it at the time. They declined and sent it to collections. 
Past due: about 3k


3. A student loan that skipped 30, and 60 days late and started at 90 days late, then went to 120, 150, 180. This was during covid when i lost my job. Then was marked ""on time"" when the lockdowns began and student loans were not being collected.

4. A rent collection, DOFD is August 2020. I tried to break the lease during covid multiple times because I had lost my job due to covid. They refused to let me break it, and being denied unemployment I was SOL. I just moved out into my parents place and let them send this to collections. 
Past due: about 7k



The good -
CapitalOne CC, started with a $200 secured card in Sept 2020. After 6 months of on time payments they upgraded it to $500. I let it sit at about $100 a month to keep my credit utilization above 0. (Is this a bad idea? Should I be paying it off to 0 every month?)

Cabelas card, opened 2 months ago (still isn't reporting to my credit report). 2k limit, I keep a balance under $300 on there. (Again, should I pay this off?)

Discover secured card, limit is $500. Haven't used this yet.

That's all information from annual credit reports.
I'm assuming it's the old, negative marks holding me down? Would a small (10k) auto loan help my credit? I have someone who would cosign for me if needed. (Ideally I'd like to just put more $ down to do it on my own)",1649081816.0

I have started looking at places in the areas I am considering but I probably wouldn't actually start looking till summertime. 

&#x200B;

I know getting new personal credit cards is not a good thing when planning to get a home loan.  My most recent personal cards were 2 cards in September of 2021 (I thought the spark select wouldn't have been personal as it's marked as a business card).  I have gotten an Amex business card more recently but as its a business card that does not affect my personal credit (other than Amex's initial first inquiry and if I don't make payments etc) I am under the assumption that my business card and acquisition of any new business cards (with Amex since they don't hp for more cards) would not affect a home loan that I would be looking to get.  Other than the credit cards I have no and had no lines of credit (like a car, school, etc payment).

My AAoA is 5 years, my total credit limit is around 33K and my utilization would be under 10% or 15% when I'd start looking for a loan (I'm currently at 17%).

I know this not the full rundown of what's needed, but I thought it would be a good starting point to give me some ideas.  Any thoughts or opinions are welcome as I am trying to get a better understanding and how to move forward that best fits my situation.

Could I actually get approved for a downpayment of around 3-5% on a 200,000 house?

due to my new personal cards in September 2021, how long should I wait till I start talking to lenders about a loan?

are my assumptions right that if I did acquire another Amex business card it would not affect my home loan?

Options?,16,tuwmxj,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tuwmxj/why_cant_i_get_a_personal_loan_with_fair_credit/,46,"So I've always been denied loans and it is very disheartening to still get denied with my decent credit and income years later. A little backstory on why I want a loan. Mainly, home improvement for the house I just bought but also because there is a car that is going up for auction in a few days, or else I would definitely have paid my credit cards down to get my credit up even more. Also, I'm 28, in case you see the school loan listed below and think I'm young and dumb.. nope.. I'm just dumb.

Anyway, here are the details on my credit in the hopes that someone can provide options that might work for me.

&#x200B;

**Credit Score:** 647 Vantage (would be higher if I paid off my credit cards) 70% utilization but I have a low limit anyway. I could pay them off with a paycheck or two and raise my credit.

**Credit Building:** I've had 2 credit cards for three years. A mortgage for the last 6 months, and a very small and feasible school loan that is still deferred until May from covid (dropped out).

**Payment History:** 100% paid on time for all loans and credit cards. 0 missed payments

**Collections:** 1 derogatory medical bill

**Hard Inquiries:** Roughly 10 from last year while home buying

**Average Credit History:**  little low due to the recent mortgage (I think 2 years?)

**Income:** Make around 54k a year with employment history in good standing

**Debt to Income Ratio:** 18% ($3,600 monthly gross after bills are paid)

&#x200B;

I hope you can see why I'm a little upset that I'm still getting denied loans and offers even from places that give loans to people with bad credit with high interest tacked on. I also want to confirm that I'm not crazy.. is it always this hard to get a personal loan?",1648942980.0

I Have a Capital One quicksilver secured card, with 400$ limit, and trying to keep the balance between 10% and 30%. my score got to 650 last month, it was looking good for me.

Then I decided due to personal reasons with time and such, I wanted a dishwasher to make things easier. OK Lowe's had some deal last month were you'd get something like 150$ off with opening a Lowe's advantage card, and no interest if i paid it off within a year. It was 900$ which I can easily do within the year.

Well stupid me misunderstood and i thought the way it'd work is it'd charge 1/12 of the price (it said  83$ a month) to the card, and as long as i paid it every month there'd be no interest, and with a 1000$ credit limit,  83$ is well within the 10-20% balance range, however i noticed the other day i got a charge for 120$. Ok, a bit more than i thought but still fine, it mentioned debt security thing if i lose my job or something, sure. But then it adds another 800$ charge to the card, which was not what i was expecting. So now i have a balance around 950$, and because of the high balance my credit score dropped 50 points and i have poor credit now.so basically is this repairable? like how hard will it be to get back to fair credit (650 range)?  or have i permanently screwed things up?

TLDR;Opened a 1000$ Lowe's advantage card for a dishwasher and misunderstood how it worked, so instead of 85$ charges every month, received the full 950$ charge so balance is 950$ and credit score dropped 50 points, not sure what to do.

I just found out my grandmother (83, but healthy and active enough to live well past 100) has been going through multiple for-profit credit counseling programs. The latest one just closed her account, but for some reason didn't pay off one of her debts.

She had a Walmart card with around $4000 on it. It was sold off to collections a long time ago. For whatever reason, this collections agency would not work with the credit counseling programs.

She has not paid or even heard from them in 3.5 years.

Her current credit score is 630. She would like to have a good credit score 'just in case' but has plenty of kids to take care of her if she ever needs to get anything.

Should she pay this debt off, or let it sit? She is getting different suggestions from different people.

My husband and I have been working on our credit score for about two years. We have made significant progress, especially since both of us had made some pretty bad financial decisions. I was almost at 700 and he was at 650. 

Well, a few months ago we had no choice but to buy another car because we both needed to commute for work. We don’t have very good public transit and since we worked the same schedule in opposite directions, we had  to do it. At the time, we didn’t have enough savings to buy a car in cash so we financed one - this was in August. We barely made the cut and we’re approved after the dealership went to a small local lender. 

It looks like the company finally reported our car loan this month (March). My credit score dropped 25 points, but my husband’s dropped 50. This sucks because he’s a veteran and we were so close to getting his credit score to 660, which we need to get a better interest rate on a VA loan to buy a house. We have been working with a mortgage lender and doing so much to repair our credit, even when we both lost our jobs when the pandemic started and I was ineligible to collect unemployment. 

Is there anything we can do to make this go away quickly? We still have a little bit of debt to pay off, but fortunately we both found jobs with substantial pay increases a few months ago. Trying to look on the bright side, but it really bums me out - especially that my husband’s score tanked like that.

119,Multiple Hard Inquirelies for one Mortgage Refi,1,tu2zc8,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tu2zc8/multiple_hard_inquirelies_for_one_mortgage_refi/,1,"I am in the United States:
Hi, I am new to this community, forgive me if this not the place to ask...

I refinanced my mortgage a couple months ago and on my Credit Karma (VantageScore 3.0) I am seeing 3 hard inquiries listed. 

Of note, I explored in depth with my mortgage holder at the time, i.e, I signed some documents but backed out before the apprasial. I submitted financial documents with another option but never signed anything and did not move forward. I ended up refinancing with a third option.

Equifax shows hard inquiries on 1.14 company X and Y and also Y again on 1.26. Trans Union shows X  and Z and again Z, for the same dates respectively.

I was of the understanding that multiple hard inquiries over a given time in reach of this type of loan results in ""one hard inquiry"". This was all less than two weeks time. Why am I seeing 3 hard inquiries? 

Since I'm here, why do three different lenders show up on two different reports, especially since I (I believe) i had my credit pulled by two lenders? The dates are the same, I would assume the lenders would be the same.

I know hard inquires are minor but would you recommend reaching out to dispute any of this? Thanks for any illumination!",1648850939.0
120,What's a good credit file?,1,tu2ki1,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tu2ki1/whats_a_good_credit_file/,3,"My entire life, according to credit karma, I've had 16 accounts... most of them were student loans but also kohl's, lenscrafters, etc. 

I've had 3 bank credit cards (down to 2 now, total balance limit is like $2,800, the other card was closed through the bank), and 1 car payment. That's all that I have in terms of credit anything. 

Once I pay off the car, I'll be down to 2 credit cards. Is that enough to have a ""healthy"" or good credit file? Other than the closed credit card, I have no bad reports (like all the store cards were paid off and closed due to inactivity. I paid off all my student loans. Things like that... all of those were like before 2018. Not sure if it matters). 

Should I hold off on paying off my car payment? I have 5k left on the loan, with a monthly payment of $416.. but I've been paying a couple thousands extra each month. I planned on getting it fully paid off by June but if only having 2 bank credit cards open is bad/looks bad for future lenders, I'm not sure what else I can do... except maybe just do a monthly $500 payment towards the loan, instead of what I've been doing. 

Only things I'd need a loan for is a house... or a car payment (but in the future, I'd rather pay it in full the day of than do another loan). 

Will future lenders be like ""yes. This person pays their stuff on time/early. Their two open cards hold a zero balance or less than 5% balance every month. This is a great person to lend to"".... or will they be like ""this person only has 2 credit lines, they pay on time/early so we probably wont get a profit off them, I'm gonna deny a loan""...?

I'm obviously not planning on going out and opening new lines of credit or anything like that. But in the future, how bad is it to only have 2 lines of credit? 

I'll also add that I'm not focusing too much on the number score... just what's considered a healthy or good credit file.",1648849868.0

401k loan would be 18k over 5 years, 3.5% Interest rate, with $300 out of my monthly pay. I also have the option to pay it off in a lump sum. With such a poor credit score, I can’t imagine being approved of a loan elsewhere to get out from under this.

These cards are now charged off 4 total, 2 of which have collections i can work with. Should I settle all 4 for 1/2 of original balance? Let them all ride till they fall off  my credit report? 

Here's my thinking to start to rebuild my credit: 1) settle the accounts that I can. 2) get a secured card or 2 and make small monthly purchases pay off balances (I know this now) and regularly add to the secured deposit to reflect credit limit increase. 3) the accounts i can't settle just let them ride and have them fall off.

First of all I wanted to say THANK YOU to all of you, as I followed the tips on this subreddit last year and got my credit score from low 600 to over 750!

I have an 25 yr old American Express account, and 2 new secure Discover cards (mine and my husband's) that we opened November 2021 and my FICO score has been hovering around 730 since then. Suddenly this month there is a drop from 728 to 666, I do have a high revolving utilization currently but have paid off all cards about 2 weeks ago, as I plan to buy a car with my husband in the next 2 months. FICO is saying my length of credit is 6 months... and this seems to be the biggest contributor to the low score. I don't understand how this could've changed in the last month??

Nothing else shows up on my credit report. related to this.

Who do I contact? Any advice on next steps? I read I'm supposed to validate all collections - but this is charge off, so do I validate? And, if so, with who?  I don't even know who they sold it to. I'd love to find a way to settle this/pay-for-delete. This is an ugly blemish an my already icky CR.

I graduated college this past May and have been working an office job since November. I filed my taxes yesterday because I made enough to get a little money back plus an owed stimulus.

A main reason was this hospital bill that sent me to collections- but my parents are adamant that our insurance covered the bill and the hospital is messing something up. Another is a closed account for a Vet bill that I never fully paid because I selected a method where I did payment plans - and before I paid in full the loaner the Vet did the payment plans with merged/went out of business. 

Now my creditKarma and Experian are saying that even if I pay these back in full, I'll receive at most 40 points. Am I just royally fucked or is there some way I could get my score back at least double those points?

When I first googled I came across this
    
1. Start sending disputes to all 3 credit reporting agencies. Every 45 days mail a new dispute based on some perceived error on your collection reports: dates, amounts, etc... If the collection agencies fails to respond to the CRA within 30 days it will be removed. The hope is that the CA has no financial incentive to respond. They have other fish to fry and completing the paperwork to respond to a paid account isn’t worth their time, hopefully. This has a small chance of working but is really the only option other than time. Best of luck.  

2. Secondly there is the ""Pay for Delete"" option  

3. ""Try this: Write a letter to each credit bureau, asking them to investigate this account. Just say ""please  
 investigate this account, and make sure that it is being reported 100% accurately."" That often does the trick. If not, dispute various parts of the account. You could also write to the creditors, after disputing with credit bureaus, and tell them the account is being reported incorrectly. These strategies, in combination, often do the trick.""
4. Another thing to try is to send a debt validation letter. If they can’t provide it, the debt is removed. My wife had 5 things in collections when I met her. After sending the letters, three were removed. You can just Google debt validation letter for the template




From my knowledge, tactics 1 and 3 can reset the accounts timeframe. I have disputed it once a couple of years ago on Credit Karma, no dice. Personally they've sent me letters trying to settle for half of it and during a phone call specifically said they wouldn't delete it off my credit. I'm not too inclined to pay at this point.

Long story short:

Amazon purchase for some reason went on an old account that I closed a long time ago.  Amazon doesn't notify me of this and instead immediately sends this debt to collections.  I receive a collections letter from TRS Recovery Services and immediately get on with Amazon and see no messages, errors, nothing strange in the invoice and I chat with their customer service.

&#x200B;

Amazon customer service told me TRS is a scam!  I filed a dispute and inquiry with TRS, but never heard back.  I eventually call TRS and they go over my Amazon account with me and show me where a disabled bank account was used on a purchase. I have no idea why but there it was.

&#x200B;

I get back on with Amazon and ask why they didn't e-mail me or message me or tell me anything other than my order went through.  Why they then told me TRS was a scam and that there was nothing wrong with my account and they had no real answer.

&#x200B;

I contacted an attorney and she said it wasn't in her wheelhouse and gave me some others to contact.  She said to meanwhile tell Amazon my rights were violated and try to resolve it internally by having them revoke the fees and collections file.

  
Meanwhile I contact Amazon who tells me they will do just that and it won't end up on my credit report, and to call TRS and pay the original item amount and nothing more.  I call TRS and they will only let me pay in full, with fees and all, and they explain that even paying this amount will be sent to the credit bureaus.  They tell me Amazon does not have such forms and does not have authority on any TRS accounts, that it's a done deal and I have to pay and that it will be reported.

Now I am on chat with Amazon and they keep sending me to the wrong teams... Spanish Team, Furniture Assembly, Fresh Produce...  How do I trust any of this?

183,Bankruptcy?,10,ts7tsv,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/ts7tsv/bankruptcy/,68,"Should I file Bankruptcy

Hello,

I have been contemplating bankruptcy for a few months now. I feel like I am drowning and I have been working 3 jobs.

Last year I made $58k (USA) but my main job is $46k and my second job varies with on call hours. Some months I make $100 some I make $800. My main job barely pays my essential living expenses. My third job is just waitressing which varies as well.

I feel like a failure and my credit score shows. I currently have a 505 score 😵‍💫
I made a lot of stupid decisions and mistakes in my younger years. I want to “reset my score” and start again at 28 years old. I have been having extreme anxiety and my chest has been hurting because of it.

My debt:
$4,500 in pay day loans
$4,500 in CC debt
$1,400 in personal loan with high interest
$11,000 in collections (I’ve been sued but I worked a payment plan with the collection agency)
$45,000 in student loans (i know are not discharged in BK)

Any advice? Please help!

For those asking about my budget..

Because my score dropped below 700 and remained under 700, my bank, Huntington, continually dropped my credit limit to just above what my monthly charges were, to the point that my current limit is a hair above $200.

This is obviously not enough to last me a full month for each payment, so I have to constantly pay off my current balance just to regain access to my account, but this means that the statements often show little to no active balance due, which means I'm effectively not paying off any debts, and therefore not increasing my score at all.

I'm not sure what to do besides max out my credit limit and start taking out cash for every other payment made the rest of the month. Are there any other options? I have no outstanding debts, and no loans. Essentially all I pay for are rent, utilities, food, and gas, with everything apartment related being a direct payment from my bank account.

I had a Target Credit card I got in 2014, I made my last payment in 2016, then stopped paying. It says closed in account status, remarks say charged off as bad debt and cancelled by credit grantor. Under payment status, payment history says ""--"" and worst payment status says ""No info"". Under account deals, for times 30/60/90 days late, it shows ""0/0/0"". Last reporting date 3/26/22.

A few questions...
1. Are any of those items that show ""--"", ""no info"", or ""0/0/0"", reasons that I could dispute it? Or are they just like that because the account has been closed?
2. If they are still reporting this recently/frequently, that means it's in collections, right? How do I know? It doesn't say the name of a collection agency. Contact info at the bottom still says TD Bank. So it's in collections, but still with them?
3. I haven't received any mail or anything about this. I did have this card and I did stop paying, yes. But I'm not receiving any notices from them, or any debt collector. I have moved since having this card, maybe they have my old address? Could I dispute for this reason?


The above info was in my TransUnion, I just looked at it under Experian, and the last payment dates and the account closed dates are different between the 2 bureaus. Experian also shows 3/1/3 for times 30/60/90 days late while TransUnion shows 0/0/0. Any possible reason to dispute here? Someone's gotta be wrong, if they both have different information, right?

The amount that I owe is not showing up in my ""collections"" balance on credit karma. It's not showing up in derogatory marks. Just under accounts/closed accounts.

I guess I'm just trying to figure out if this is in collections, why am I not receiving anything about it, and can I/should I dispute for any of the reasons I described above?

Today this amount of debt hit my credit report (well over $10,000) and my credit score dropped to 688. It looks like this is due to the sharp increase in utilization (each month I put less than $1,500 on my CC previously).

My car was recently stolen and in it, my checkbook. The thief begin writing fradulent checks so I had to immediately cancel my account.

Essentially, the insurance paid off my remaining balance and told me I was good to go. However, my last payment to the car financer ended up bouncing because of the closed checking account. After this, they claim I owed them the last payment - however they never communicated that to me. Months went by and I thought I was fine until I found two late payment dings on my credit report from them. I called and was eventually able to figure out the reasoning and am now disputing it with them via mail.

Since it was closed about a year ago I have been making consistent, on-time payments (above the minimum.) My question is: do payments on a closed account contribute to positive payment history on my credit report? The balance is now under 20% of the limit, and if I were to pay it down to $0 now, it would add one more on-time payment to my credit history. If I paid the minimum, I could add another 10 months of positive payment activity to my credit report. Do closed accounts with a balance actually contribute to payment history? Or do credit reports only factor in payment history from currently open accounts?

I hope this is clear, I'm trying to decide between paying off the closed account in full and getting one more positive payment on my credit reports, or drawing it out so that I gain 10 more positive payments on the reports to push my % of on-time payments higher (currently 96%, every payment helps push it higher.)

Additionally, since I'm technically still adding payment history to my credit report, has this closed account been contributing to my average age of credit / length of credit history with each monthly payment? If I stretched the payments out for another 10 months, would it also technically add 10 more payments that contribute to the average age of credit?

I guess this isn't a very common scenario, since I have exhausted reddit threads and Google trying to find an answer for this specific case.

Well after burning almost 40,000$ in a weeks span (with multiple pending transactions) I ended up depositing another 2000 via PayPal ACH. Once everything had posted I had a -2000$ balance. I called the bank and asked them how I could even go into the negative if I specifically set up no over drafting for my account and the woman told me I had 90 days to pay it and that I could just move on with my life. 


Well I ended up getting further into my addiction and just let them close the account. I have multiple bank accounts and i just didn’t care. HOWEVER, now that I’m getting my head back on straight.

I have a $300 credit limit with capital one, unsecured (got it about 3 months ago). ive payed it in full every month, but this month, i left a 1 dollar balance to show im using my available credit, rather than not at all. I read that could help my score. Ill let you know how it goes.

I'm using the extra card, [cred.ai](https://cred.ai) card, experian boost, and grow credit right now. i have a 97% approval chance with credit ones card based on experian and an outstanding chance for mission lanes cash back visa card through credit karma, but I don't want another hard pull. My report is showing 2 pulls right now, and im disputing one because I genuinely don't recognize it. Would the additional credit line be worth the hard pull? and I'm self employed. income proof because of my job type is super annoying and often impossible. So, I'd rather not apply, they require proof of income, I cant provide what they want, and then it's too bad.  I've tried petal, but they don't like me for whatever reason.

I don't have a mortgage or active auto loan. What other tools can I use, credit lines can i apply for, or loans should i have in order to get that good spread of diff accounts that would help my score? I don't care about high interest rates or even annual fees since I won't be using the card, unless I'm paying it in full or down to a dollar. I just want to boost my score as high as possible asap. My brother might put me as an authorized user, but he's incredibly high up the chain as a financial officer at a bank, and they check his report every month. he's not sure he's allowed to, but is checking for me. no one else i trust to not miss a payment.

I’ve never used any form of credit before and this account was recently transferred to my name.
 (With my consent of course)
The account has a 200$ credit limit, and for the first 2 months I paid soon after the bill was issued. 

So I brought my remaining credit down to 80$ after my 120$ phone bill. 
Then paid what I owed within a day or so.
So my credit limit went back up to 200$.

Now the issue.
I was billed on October 5th and I forgot to pay that bill. 
Then I was billed again on November 5th and I forgot to pay again. 

So I passed my credit limit and my phone was shut off on the Morning of November 6th.

This is the first and only time I exceed my 200$ credit limit. 

So I realized my mistake and paid my first bill on November 6th then went to work. 
My remaining credit was at 70$ and I could use my phone. 

Then comes December 1st,
I pay the second bill I owed from November so my credit limit went up to 200$ again.


Scenario 2
Now on December 5th I was billed again.
So on December 8th I paid 60$ to “smartly” use the credit. 

But then forgot to pay until January 6th.
So I realized and paid the remainder of December’s bill on January 6th. 
My service was not cut off and I did not exceed my credit limit because I paid 60$ on December 8th.

Would my credit be negatively impacted in this second scenario? 
I don’t think so because I did not exceed my credit limit. 

Anyways I was billed on January 
5th and paid on the 25th. 

Since then I’ve been paying immediately after I am billed. 



Do you think the first scenario negatively impacted my credit.
I did exceed my credit limit within my bell account.
I have been funding it with a debit card. Not a credit card.
So hopefully that helps me. 

Honestly I’m a noob at this, and I’m planning on getting a credit card soon so I can build my my credit.  I’ll be doing more research on that.

But I’m concerned that this mistake has already damaged/sunk my credit.

Part of this has been diligently waiting for a charge off and collection to drop off my account — and now, that will happen May 1, 2022 and June 1, 2022. The other half of this has been paying every account on time, if not over, every month. I've managed to keep my score hovering around the 650s for the last year — annoying, but not terrible. 

In Feb. 2019, I was able to receive a $9k auto loan from my credit union to assist in the purchase of a used car. I paid off that loan in Feb. 2022. As soon as the payoff was reported to the credit bureaus, my credit score plummeted on all three reports over 20 points — all from around 655-659 to about 630-638. Nothing significant has changed besides paying off the car loan. (I also never missed a car loan payment.)

Why did this happen? Will it ever rebound? They haven't moved since doing this.

Other negatives: I have $100k in student loans from undergrad and grad school. (I had a 75% scholarship for undergrad, but had to pay grad school out of pocket. I also have a credit card with 60% usage, but I'm waiting for an insurance reimbursement of $4k that caused the high usage rate.

What should I do to help return my score to what it was before?

Also, I've read that I could try calling all three credit agencies to have them remove the chargeoff / collections set to expire in May and June earlier. Is this possible? What impact will removing these chargeoffs happen to my score, whether I remove them now or when they expire?

The eventual goal is that I'd like to buy a house; I am a native Californian, and even though I make $120k a year, I know I need a perfect credit score to even have a chance in buying a house. I won't have any assistance from family to do so, so I need all the convincing of the bank I can get.

Trying to build enough credit to buy a house. Currently, my score is in the 669-678 (TransUnion vs Equifax) and I got a credit card through my credit union back in November-ish. I use it solely for credit building, so to fill up my tank each month and then pay it off in full. It seemed like that was working and my score was going up steadily. Then, in the past couple months, it dipped (10-15 points each time) for reasons I didn't understand. Based on my trajectory before these dips, I was very excited to get to the 700 range in the next month or so, so it was pretty demoralizing watching my progress disappear.

I searched around on here and pieced together that, even if you're paying off bills on time, the bank or credit card company sends a report and the credit agency bases your score on the balance at that time. I could have that wrong. (The unending shifting goals drive me insane!)

I called my credit union and they said they send the report around the first of the month. So, to plan for this, would it work if I make a purchase and then immediately pay it down to a few dollars so there's a low balance when they report, and then pay that remaining amount off before the due date?

In Summer 2020, I received a letter from a collections agency regarding an unpaid utility bill for less than $200. This unpaid debt was reported on my credit reports and lowered my score from almost 800 to somewhere in the 600s. I did some digging and I in fact did miss paying my last bill in 2018 when I was moving apartments (utility company never reached out to me and I never checked their website since I thought I was fully settled and had moved to a different utility company).

I followed the advice on this sub and sent a debt validation letter to the collections agency and within a month or so, the hit was taken off my credit report and the collection agency sent some letter basically saying they would back off.

Now two years later I received a letter from a 2nd collections agency regarding the same debt. This time, my credit has not yet been hit. I am going to send another debt validation letter, but this company offered in their initial letter a 50% repayment to cease all future collections.

I am happy to pay the \~$100 to end all of this since the debt is actually correct, but wanted to see what the proper steps are to achieve this will end once and for all? Since my credit hasn't taken a hit this time, will paying this debt actually end the saga for good?

I assumed when the 1st agency backed off and removed the credit hit, this would be over, but I didn't know the debt could then move to another agency.

I was recently  approved for Care Credit card through Synchrony bank for $4900. I was shocked b/c my credit is terrible and I'm just starting the repair journey.  We ended up only needing $800 on the card - to be paid back in installments over the next 6 months, interest free. 

I have the enough to pay the full $800 off right now  but I'm not sure if this is the best or should I pay it off over time to show I can pay on time, etc.

Right now, other than mortgage, I do not have any monthly payments - my credit card was charged off (I'm about to settle that). No car payment, no loans, etc.  I thought maybe having a monthly payment for 6 months might help with my score - or should I just pay and get it over with - balance down to zero ASAP?

Thanks in advance...",1648488861.0

I just enjoyed a huge score jump after I paid all my cards off at once. I know scores are different all over but I use CK to track the 2 scores there Transunion/Equifax. In all the years I've been using CK those 2 scores have always been within a few points of each other. They were never more than 5 points over or under from each other and now there is a 14 point difference and it's especially frustrating because one (Equifax) finally has me in the excellent category (760) I've been so desperate to get to and the other still has me in the good at 746.  

The only difference between the 2 scores is the lower one has 2 hard inquiries the other doesn't. I feel like 14 points is a pretty significant ding for just 2 inquiries that are both going to be a year old in a few months.  Why does one have them and the other not and how long until they fall off or stop making such a big ding? The site says they should lower the impact after a few months but it has been over that by now.",1648485884.0

Here is my info:

Accounts:

Best Buy CC - balance 0/2000 - age 2yrs

PNC Cash Rewards - balance 5300/6800 - age 3yrs

Mortgage - age 4mo

0 late payments ever

score was 754 when I applied for the mortgage, I expect it would be lower now due to the hard pull during mortgage application, plus a higher CC balance due to some related one-time expenses such as buying a lawnmower etc.

My understanding from other posts is that Cap 1 likes to see a lot of usage.  I've also come across a few older posts on this sub and on the Credit Cards sub about cycling that have me a bit concerned.  During the Feb statement period I had about $1920 of usage and the balance was near 90% at one point (I bought my new phone via this card) though my closing balance was below 20% (I pay off everything so no interest).  This month I had about $2400 in usage though I did not let the balance exceed 50% at all during the billing cycle and reporting around 12% at statement closing. I've basically been using this card for roughly 85% of all my transactions in place of a debit card (the remainder are a handful on a secured Discover (mainly gas due to a better reward) and I keep a few on my debit card just to maintain active usage) and just pay off my bill multiple times per month.

Hi,

I've read a lot of about the credit repair process and have implemented  a lot of those tools. What question I have is if I should just wait for these to drop off versus getting on payment plans. I really didn't want to do this, since I can't really afford it at the moment and can't settle. I know there is always a risk of being sued, though. Getting on a payment plan would also mean that it would change the date of the last payment, and many of these cards would take a long time to pay off. It is really not something I can afford. Capital One, Amex are some creditors, which means I'm probably blacklisted. I have my own $5,0000 with no balance in case I need credit, some store cards, and an authorized /joint user for other cards totaling another 80k in credit. I know I owe them this debt, but worried I'll just be wasting my money at this point. Not looking to file bankruptcy at this point. Just curious to get some opinions.",1648429147.0

Can you tell me: do student loans figure in to debt-to-income ratio? I thought they did not, but was refused offers when I did a soft-pull pre-approval for a Discover card, and they said it was because of my debt-to-income ratio.

For reference:
I am recently back in the work force, so my income is not great but decent. I am rebuilding my credit, and my Experian fico was 714 until I finished paying off a delinquent Amex account in August. They reported the account as closed to the bureaus and my score dropped to 665 (oof). It came up a little to 670 in December.

I have one car loan with my husband that has about 1500 left on it and a credit card in my husband's name that I'm an authorized signer for (we're separated, it's complicated), but the balance on that card is 0. (My husband's income is significantly better than mine, though I didn't include his income in the pre-approval application.)

I do have huge student loan debt (federal, not private) that will likely  take me 15-20 years to pay back. I have a perfect repayment history in that debt.

1. Made a payment with my Venmo card and it turns out Venmo doesn't allow ACH payments so that got declined. 

2. My new credit union hand wrote my account number and a 2 looks like 3 and so I gave Premiere the wrong info and that payment was declined.

My current loan is at 7%, $9100'ish payoff, 31 months remaining. I ran a pre-qual at the capital one website and they qualified me for a loan for around 5.6% interest on my 697 transunion fico score.

I am 23 now. When I was a senior in high school my 12 year old autistic brother was diagnosed with stage 3 bone cancer and had to get his leg amputated. My mom has crazy anxiety so half way through my senior year I was kicked out of my house for “bringing in germs” I was homeless staying with friends for about a year. I am a musician. I was a fairly successful one at that in my city. I would dj almost every night and was brought in over 100k in 2018. Since I was doing good I opened 4 credit cards to buy new gear to open a studio. 2 gear cards that were at a 3k limit and a furniture card at a 2k limit I maxed them out (I know this is dumb now but at the time I knew 0 about credit) Everything was going good until the pandemic hit and 90% of my income went away. I was looking for new jobs when I was in a car wreck and broke my leg. At this time I kidna gave up on life a dealt with pretty gnarly drug addiction and just kidna let all my responsibilities fade. Early 2020 my step dad had a major heart attack and my mom was now a single mom with no help for my autistic brother and sister. This woke me up and a I quit drugs and started helping my mom. I am now a care giver for my brother via CDS and it’s now my job. He is able to go back to normal in person school now so I am about to get a second full time job (I can crae give for my brother from 6-11 at night)

The loan was originally $30,000, but after interest and fees they tried to get me to pay $69,000.  We have agreed on a settlement of $32,500 but the lender is being a stickler about reporting it as ‘settled’ rather than ‘paid in full’ to the credit agencies. 

Since this has already fallen off my credit report, will settling reactive it and make it show up again as ‘settled’ and affect my score? If not, are there any consequences for them to report it as settled? Or has the damage already been done?

it's me again.

right now i have a 824 FICO 8 credit score, with a credit profile consisting of: (1) Discover It Card with a $2000 limit, and (1) long term installment in the form of student loans which i begin being responsible paying back in May 2022. my credit age is 7 years.\*

it took me really long to complete undergrad due to health reasons, so my credit age is 7 years with my long term installment, student loans, being the longest.\*

&#x200B;

(see my 3 questions below)

&#x200B;

**a little bit about my experience with the discover it card:**

* **length:** 1.5 years
* **payment history:** always on time, and never missed a payment
* **utilization:** the first year, unfortunately, i had kept a consistent high utilization (pretty much maxed out) up until January 2022.  

   * ***since then, for the last 4 months i've reported a utilization of 0-4% \*\*\****  

      * this had resulted a major spike in my credit score leading to **upwards of 800, today: 824**
* **limit:** i started with $1500 limit, until this past week i asked for a credit limit increase; to which Discover only increased by $500 despite my significant increase of available income\* and decreased housing risk of living with my parents with $0 rent.  

   * ***current limit = $2,000***
* **other important info:** i recently successfully referred a friend to join Discover and I've activated AutoPay for the minimum due + $10, and i make at least 2+ payments in a single cycle

&#x200B;

**long term installment (student loans):**

Age: 7 Years.

Amount: \~20k which I begin to pay off in May

&#x200B;

**my questions are:**

 **1. i understand a good credit mix consists of 2 CC, 1 short term installment, and 1 long term installment. to expand my current credit mix, do you suggest i open a Line of Credit with a with a Co-Signer at a Credit Union, open a 2nd Credit Card, and/or Open a small Loan with a bank (also w a Co-Signer) ?**

&#x200B;

**2. OR do u rather suggest i work on bettering my credit mix \*only\* thru adding a 2nd CC for now?**

&#x200B;

**3. and lastly, the** **most** **important question:**

**\*WHEN\* do you think is a most favorable time for me to apply for my 2nd credit card/line of credit/loan given the aforementioned year's worth of high utilization (BUT no missed payments, and recently: at least 4 months of low utilization (0-4%), autopay activation, multiple payments in single cycle, successful friend referral, fair credit age of 7 years) i'm recovering from?**

Total Credit length or the Score itself since it takes that into account?

Background: I am 23, great credit history, one previous auto loan I got when I was 19 with my Dad as a cosigner, opened one credit card at 20, one at 21, and one more at 22. So my average credit history is around 2 years or so averaging all lines of credit. I have never missed a payment and have a FICO of high 730s, sometimes 740s. I see my score through experian.

I have owned outright my current car for 4 years and love it, but I will be driving a lot more and do not want to put more mileage on current car. It also gets 15mpg which I just cant handle as I plan to drive 30k miles this year. We want a new car that gets good gas mileage that wont depreciate too much with putting miles on. My income is around $3-5k/month.

I found a 2015 car with 30k miles on it with a rebuilt title. Yeah, I know not many people like them but I like them because I know cars very well and am skilled at negotiating. I talked the seller down to selling the car for 50% of the value of the car. My credit union I have used for years for everything has a policy they will loan up to 60% to the value of the car. NADA has the car booked at $31k. I negotiated down to $16k and figured I would have no problem with getting the loan for the full amount.

After applying in person, they said that they could only approve me for a $10,000 loan, and would expect me to pay a $7k down payment. I talked with the rep and he said he didn't know why, so he went to talk to his manager about it. They then escalated the app to corporate and said it would be undergoing review. He only speculated my shorter credit history may have something to do with it.

My question is:

If credit length is included in your credit score, why do banks and credit unions even look at length?

Could it just be that the system is changing and they are no longer willing to loan 60% value of rebuilt titles?

Would I have the same problem trying to buy a car for more $$ at a dealership either through my CU or their alternatives? As opposed to a private seller.

It’s been between 730-740 based on FICO scores provided by Discover and Experian Basic. 

History:

-This month marks 7 years since I filed for CH7 bankruptcy. 

-No reported collections. 

-2 installment loans. Auto loan opened 3 months ago and already 8% paid off. Refinanced student loan that is 3.5 years old but only 7% paid off. I haven’t made a payment in the last 2 years because of the federal forbearance. 

-5 unsecured charge cards. Reported Utilization is less than 1%. 3 of the charge cards of carry a small reported monthly balance (less than $30 each). 

-3 hard pulls, but I believe they only count as one because they are all for my recent auto loan and pulled on the same day. 

-1 “30-59 day late” payment from June 2015 on a closed auto loan account.

I always pay my credit cards off in full within a week of incurring any charges. The debt collection agency is United Collection Bureau. Their website seems legit? https://ucbinc.com/

They called while I was in the shower and left a voicemail stating they were calling in reference to collecting a debt but did not mention my name or anything about what the debt was over and left a phone number to call back. I called the number back and they refused to tell me anything unless I gave them my name and birthdate. All I gave them was my cell phone number and that I was calling them back since they left me a voicemail. I did not feel comfortable giving this over the phone so we ended the call and got nowhere.

338,Lost.. What’s Next?,3,tnos0l,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tnos0l/lost_whats_next/,3,"I started at 630, I’m lost, how I got my points up in 3 months to 681 FICO and 667 for score reported to TransUnion, the other is 390 etc, I only care of TransUnion, it’s always the lowest plus the same as on my Discover card. 

Ok I’m frustrated because I feel it’s not fast enough, I don’t have 8 years or 15. To see 800, I’m fine with having a  725 or of course would take more at least and my FICO at 750, not sure how long I will live, it’s complicated, I look very normal but dying within, like to enjoy life for the next several years. 

I’d like to ideally have my credit to this number at 725  by January, Is this unrealistic? I’m sick of hearing not always denied. 
Ok for bills 

I owe 3,680 for my last credit card, rest zero  I have 4 small ones. I co-signed for two trucks but my husband and I,  one is 23,000 his but I’m listed first, he second one is 34,000 this I’m second and is a 2021 Colorado. 

For loans I’m down to 3,800 2 is 1,600 3rd is 2,700.  Last I co-sign for hubby and I home repairs we owe 11,000 now so have brought that one with litestream, I always try to pay extra, this credit card has been good to me. 

It angers me from one loan listed above because Its paid down to paid 3,810, was reporting but stopped, for months now still sitting at 4,779 or 4,690. TransUnion is the 4779  Trust me I blow up the loan companies phone , never a supervisor to talk to, and investigations to the point all three credit bureau’s won’t let me put another one it, they all three say investigating. 
Any ideas anything I can do on this high end loan that was 11,000 high risk loan of 33 percent!!  ? 

Anyway am lost, why did my score go to 636 to now in 3 months, I pay all or have payment arrangements ( all medical) not on my credit. I have one negative paid off bc Kay’s did me wrong, Genisis refused to budge, but they are fixing the dates they closed, I did not miss 90 days. We were supposed to have a promo from Kay’s but not! We have paid right on the spot, paid off the rest, last dime. As I told them to check out the records, I only get 14 months, covid I paid all my bills, even in the hospital I had on direct pay as I sat in the icu, huge surgery with bad complications. I’ve never gone into collections, I’d know I was late during covid on my report, so they are investigating the dates which is a plus or I went over balance when I only bought two small items. I do believe this will be fixed. 
I’m though very happy at 3 months ago I was at 630 not 667 and my FICO at 681
 
My Goal and is it possible? 
I am trying to get to 700 without using  any of my cards  until at a 0, will use to buy a tank of gas, pay before ending cycle, next time the other card. Right now all are at 0, nor want to apply for a loan at this time at all! Any suggestions how? 
My revolving state 34 or 36 on some 
48 percent credit used some 51?? 
But one of the credit reports is killing me stating I need to re- finance our  trucks, not happening, my truck is almost a year old, why I refuse to, plus my husbands truck, we are almost there next year, it’s not that high financing except though low I hate Wells Fargo, feel in another year to find a better deal. 
I believe I only trust TransUnion than the rest to follow my credit & Discover Card. 
Btw credit revolving is 72 ( I only owe 3800 which I just paid again to 3600 

Revolving Accounts -67credit-  
Current 72 utilization
And 67 for credit card current use so am lost!

So back in 2015-2018 I had multiple late payments on one credit card (charged off) and my car (I have since paid it off and sold it)
I also had two bills go to collections.  One from Sallie Mae and another from care credit. 
And several payday loans went to collections as well. 
At one point my score was around 470. 

Since then, I’ve paid off most of my debt. Sallie Mae and care credit are showing payments being made and for Sallie Mae it will take the derogatory marks off after 9 months of consecutive payments.  

I haven’t had a late payment in about 3 years now. I use Experian and pay for it and my credit score is showing 628 for Experian, 629 for Equifax, and 650 for trans Union. My bank switched from FICO to Vantage and shows me at 623.


We recently applied for a rental and for once I wasn’t as concerned about credit.  However I was told my score was 577.  It showed the late payments from the car (understandable) and an old credit card that was charged off back in 2017.  It also showed my current credit card with no late payments and an installment loan I have.  

I’m just so confused.  I’ve been monitoring all 3 bureaus and none of it was in the 500s.  Part of the report from the rental place said I didn’t have enough lines of credit so I opened a new credit card with capital one (I don’t Plan on using it more than once a month and paying it off in the same month) but I haven’t had a late payment in years.  I keep waiting for my collection debt to be taken off cause I feel like that will raise it by a lot but now I’m not so sure.  


Was opening a second credit card the right move? Is there anything else I can do besides waiting a while and let time do it’s thing? Is there something else I should be using to monitor my scores?",1648219982.0

My credit score is still rising as I make on time payments and right the wrongs. I was pre-approved for 11% which I know is high but I was wondering if this could lower due to two things:

First I would be trading in my current car towards a new one which I own outright. Est value $17,000-$19,000. This would be going towards a car that costs about $34,000.

Secondly, I have a high income job making about ,$80,000/year. 

Are the rates I see on capital ones pre-approval locked in for me or could they change?

Also is it possible I get denied at the dealership due to my past even though I was pre-approved?

I have a POSITIVE BALANCE on my Amazon account from some returned things.  I have several bank accounts in good standing in my Amazon Wallet.

So.... TRS sends another letter and I try calling and it is hard to reach them.  I finally get someone that gives me information and contact Amazon again.

I asked why they didn't contact me and didn't get an answer.  I asked why they waited less than a month to send to collections(the item was bought Jan 14).  They said I'm sorry this is frustrating for you.

Filed a police report after the fact.

Sent this to Aladdin bail bond. Found out 6 months later this isn't sufficient evidence, and sent me a copy of the application

The name is misspelled, my birthday is wrong, place of employment wrong, email address wrong, never had an account with the bank specified.

I'm told none of that matters. They tell me all that matters is they had my id. Told them had be lost/stolen several times since issue date.

Theyre asking for dmv record of that (have it) and proof my ip address doesn't match and they'll consider it.

Have a feeling they won't.

Absolutely incredible that someone can go in and establish a line of credit with no verification and an id that doesn't match the person at the office. Cannot be legal. And if I was the debt collector I'd be pissed that Aladdin sent sold an obviously fraudulent account and demand a charge back but that isn't happening.

I checked the lenders I already do business with and decided the WF card was probably better than the other options. I applied last Friday with a banker and heard today that they denied it because my consumer card with them had ""not been open long enough."" It's been open since 2018 with perfect payment history and never carried a balance. The banker agreed that should be long enough and asked for the last 6 months statements and payments with Amex to resubmit. Also perfect payment history and no carrying a balance. 

The supplier didn't give much notice for the payment change and I don't make expansions until they are needed. In this case, I need to.

WF did a hard pull on my credit but time is getting down to the wire here. I have back orders with the supplier and I don't know when they are going to ship. 

I'm getting antsy that WF is going to dig their heels in and if I wait too long I won't have another card for the supplier and I'll have to sever the relationship.

I made some stupid decisions a couple years ago when money was tight, and I stopped paying off two credit cards that were store cards for Best Buy (Citi) and Guitar Center (synchrony). Both of those last payments were around June 2020.  

Those accounts are now in collections: synchrony is with PRA, and citi is with LVNV (ERC). There's been some damage done to my credit score, not too terrible luckily, though I'd still like to handle these in the best possible way towards my score now. 

I got my 3 credit reports and sure enough both of those are on there as collections accounts. What I'm not understanding is, there's absolutely nothing indicating a ""charge off"" occurred explicitly, which confuses me because I thought an account being in collections means there must be a charge off as well. Even with equifax (I think it was that one, I don't have the report in front of me), they have a code ""CO"" specifically for charge off and its nowhere in my report, though there are the collections accounts. Even weirder to me, the original 2 credit cards, which I had made payments to both for a while, don't show up at all in any of the reports, only the collections accounts.

I know charge offs are horrible for your report, so this gives me some excitement. Further, I know PRA does pay for delete (and they've told me this explicitly in the letter and online), and from reading online people's luck with pay for delete with LVNV is good as well.

**My 1st question is**: If I have nothing in my report about charge offs, and these collections will delete their tradeline after I've paid, does that mean there'll be no record of the charge off?! The original 2 credit cards (which I had made payments to for a while) actually *don't show up at all* in any of my reports. Only the collections accounts. Is it possible after the tradelines are delete, the original charge offs/accounts will start showing all of a sudden?

**2nd Question**: PRA specifically says I can pay the full amount and it will mark the account ""paid in full"", or I can do a lower amount and it will mark ""paid in less than full"". If I know that  PRA will delete the tradeline after 30 days as per their policy anyway, is there any reason whatsoever to pay the full amount, or should I just go with the settled? I assume there'll be a similar deal with LVNV/ERC.

3rd, unrelated, bonus question: been paying an auto loan that's almost over for 5 years now with a local credit union, perfect record, but that shows up nowhere on my report. Is there a process to go through to get the account in my credit history? Should I just call them and see what they say?",1647969638.0

The changes are as follows and will go into effect in July:

•Medical debt that was paid after it was sent to collections will be removed from reports!

•Unpaid medical debts won’t get added to credit reports for a full year after being sent to collections

•Removal of unpaid medical debt of less than $500 (won’t go into effect until first half of next year and could be increased from $500)

The changes come in response to the CFPB announcing it planned to hold credit reporting firms accountable for inaccurate reporting when it comes to medical debt. This isn’t the first time the CFPB has looked into this issue with a 2014 report showing that medical debt and non medical debt aren’t equivalent when it comes to determining a consumers credit worthiness. In 2015 changes were made that meant medical debt wasn’t added for 180 days.

It’s expected that these changes announced by the consumer reporting agencies will remove approximately 70% of medical debt currently reported on consumers reports. Most new scoring models discard or reduce the importance of medical debt as it’s not a great indicator of credit worthiness, so these changes shouldn’t come as a surprise.

I have a 2017 Jeep Compass with about 80,000 miles, and there's about 12,000$ left on the loan. It's starting to have issues and the Jeep is worth more then what's owed (around $18,000 is what it's worth that I've appraised online). I figured I'd just go down and get something new. I make about 40,000$ a year pre taxes. My CScore is a 710 on Experian.

The dealership wouldn't let me get a car without a cosigner. This makes no sense as this would be my third car (had a focus, then the jeep, then the newer car I was trying to buy) and the first two I had to have NO co signer. In fact, my debt, income, and credit was way worse, and then they were willing to give me better payments, and better percent rates. Which again - I don't get.

It was midly annoying as I was literally filling out paperwork and able to test drive it and they were like ""lol nope, we will call you if anything changes!"", after I'd been there for like, 3 hours?

I guess I""ll drive this until the wheels fall off and I own it outright,  but I'm trying to figure out why I needed a cosigner.

I have about a $20,000 student loan, my cart, and maybe $6,000 in mis debt (had braces - no interest on those, a loan i used for a vacation, and my credit card thats almost paid off).

Any advice as to why / if I should just keep my Compass is appreciated. I'm trying to figure out what to do, since the Compass is starting to show signs of decline.",1647867180.0

It was subsequently stolen from in front of my apartment 8 months later in October of 2019. I didn’t have the proper theft insurance so I needed to continue making payments to avoid an extreme demerit on my credit report.  At the time, I had a few parking tickets that i was going to pay, but since I wasn’t planning on seeing the bike again, I never paid them. I had auto pay on for the payments and never missed a single one; despite not even being in possession of the bike. 7-8 months later in June/July of 2020, the sheriffs department located the bike while serving a warrant and had me come pick it up. I took it to the mechanic to have it repaired. I got it back about a month later and by that time, the old parking tickets totaled up to about $1400; preventing me from registering it right away. On my way home, I was pulled over and the motorcycle was impounded for expired tags. By the time I had enough money for the registration, the tow fees were $1700. I then surrendered it to the finance company, knowing they would sell it at an auction and hopefully take some money off the principal of my loan. I knew I would have to pay the tow fees at some point but I naively thought it would be added to the principal. They then added the $1700 to my current amount due for that month without notifying me.

My daughter died in 2018 three days after being transported to a NICU by an ambulance company. She was retroactively added to our insurance plan and all related medical bills were covered. 

About one year later I received a bill from the ambulance for about $8000 that was not billed to the insurance.

I spoke to my insurance company who verified that she was covered and asked that the ambulance company resubmit the claim.

There are no changes to my numbers (vantage, I believe, but maybe fico.i don't think so tho), and no explanations as to why they've disappeared.

In doing a bit of research I saw that sometimes a new agency will buy from the old one and wondering, first, if it's likely that that is what happened and they haven't been reported yet, and secondly, if that resets or affects the drop-off date or statute of limitations.

How should I go about getting this removed? Can I dispute this? Why is there not another creditor reported on any reports regarding this account?

The biggest credit-reporting firms will strip tens of billions of dollars in medical debt from consumers’ credit reports, erasing a black mark that makes it harder for millions of Americans to borrow.

Equifax Inc., Experian and TransUnion are making broad changes to how they report medical debt beginning this summer. The changes, which have been in the works for several months, will remove nearly 70% of medical debt in collections accounts from credit reports.


Beginning in July, the companies will remove medical debt that was paid after it was sent to collections. These debts can stick around on a consumer’s credit report for up to seven years, even if they are paid off. New unpaid medical debts won’t get added to credit reports for a full year after being sent to collections.


The firms are also planning to remove unpaid medical debts of less than $500 in the first half of next year. That threshold could rise, according to people familiar with the matter",1647610659.0

From zero credit to $31,500 in combined credit cards and line of credit.  

It all started with a $500 secured credit card 2 years ago which is still active but never used. Called the bank about having the $500 reimbursed or upgrading to a different card while retaining the same account number - but no can do.  I’m reluctant to cancel it because it’s my oldest account…all the other stuff came fast and furious in the last 8-9 months. 

It’s only $500 but I hate the thought of it sitting there interest free…especially since my new creditworthiness deserves better…especially when there are other credit card products like the Cryptocurrency Visa that’ll generate returns on a $500 deposit. 

Will it negatively impact my credit score if I cancel this secured card?  Thanks!",1647659974.0

I'm looking for some advice on a charge off account that I have. It's been an extremly rough few years filled with the loss of loved ones and other personal struggles. I've finally gotten to a good place financially and have started settling some of my previous debts!

 I have one debt that's a charge off but they haven't been reporting monthly. I'm quite fearful that if I pay off this account it will cause them to update the delinquencies/charge off on my credit report. This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't trying to get approved for an apartment and I'm afraid I can't take the hit to my credit. My credit used to be excellent until this rough patch and now it's sitting in the mid 600s FICO. Another one of my charge offs was updated monthly so I know that it was keeping my score suppressed but I'm unsure of this debt that isn't being updated monthly

I guess my question is will paying off this debt cause me to lower my credit score and if so should I be strategic when I pay it off due to needing an apartment. I will of course pay off this debt but want to make sure I'm understanding the situation correctly as there are so many conflicting opinions on this.

512,Recently found collections account. What to do?,2,thk2r2,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/thk2r2/recently_found_collections_account_what_to_do/,2,"
Hello all,

First off, sorry if my explanation is horrible, if more details are necessary , I will do my best to add them in the thread. I just recently found this subreddit and have been reading a whole lot on Collections and what to do when one shows in one’s credit report.

So reason I’m even asking questions about collections is because my girlfriend recently found out through looking at her Equifax report through CreditKarma, that she has an account in collections from an apartment complex that she lived in back in college, which was ~4 years ago.

The collection shows for 204$, opened 4 yrs ago, with a date reported of 3/3/2022 and no date of delinquency.

To her knowledge, she has never received a call, email, or mail with regards to this collection, and if it weren’t because she recently checked her credit report in quite a while (because she recently got her first credit card), she wouldn’t even know that she had an account in collections.

I took it a little further and found out it doesn’t show on her TU report, but it does show on Experian. So EX and EQ show the account.

I’m honestly unsure what she needs to do to get this off her credit report and I’m seeking tips or steps and what she can do next to get this resolved ASAP. An ideal scenario would be that this doesn’t have to stay on her credit report for 7 years.

So what would you all recommend?

Dispute? Call the original creditor and see what’s going on? Send a debt validation letter to the collector? Ignore it (although it seems that this is not the best answer)?

Sorry if I sound like a newb, I’ve never had to deal with collections, and I would hate for this to come back and bite my girlfriend back if she ignores it. She’s looking into getting a car financed soon and I’d hate for her to get a higher APR cause of this.

Many thanks in advance. Look forward to some tips on this.",1647652126.0

514,Weird Collections Situation - Need Advice,1,thizh2,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/thizh2/weird_collections_situation_need_advice/,3,"I'm going to try and be as detailed as possible because I can't find anything online about my particular situation. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

June 17th 2018 I signed a contract with a gym in South Carolina and never ended up going. I was freshly 18 and very irresponsible. I never made a single payment towards the gym, and on March 5th 2019 I received my final email from the gym notifying me that I was delinquent and would be sent to collections soon. These notifications were sent to an email I no longer used, and I honestly had zero idea I was even receiving them.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I received a call from a collections agency and I'm going to try and describe how the conversation went to the best of my memory, without giving the details of which company it was. Idk if that would somehow come back to bite me.

C: Hello am I speaking with x?

x: Yes that's me who is this?

C: This is soandso with the collections company, how are you.

x: I'm fine, I'm pretty sure I don't owe any debt, but before we start if I do, do you guys have any kind of grace period that I can pay within before it's reported to my credit?

C: Well actually this account was reported to your credit back in 2018, for Gym with an amount of $942.

x: No that doesn't sound right.. I have nothing negative on my credit and I think you have the wrong person.

C: Oh okay

x: Yea sorry wrong number, have a good one

Call ended

&#x200B;

So here are the facts and what I think I know.

Facts:

* Nothing has been reported to my credit
* This is the first time I've received a call or any kind of notification about this debt from this agency.
* The address used on the contract was a friends house that cannot be tied to me in any way
* They do not have my SSN

What I think I know:

* South Carolina has a statute of limitations of 3 years for debts, which starts on the first day I failed to make payment
* A collections company cannot report a debt to the credit bureaus that has surpassed the statute of limitations

&#x200B;

How do you guys think I should handle this? Should I just ignore it? I feel like if they were able to report me to the credit bureaus it would have happened years ago. Are they able to still report me even though it has been over 3 years? I have no problem paying the debt, or even twice that amount if it means my credit will be intact, but I don't want to make any moves that could screw me. Thank you to anyone that can help inform me on my situation.",1647648731.0

I've been using Credit Karma which allows me to see derogatory marks against my credit. I have $750 in collections that I'm working on getting taken care of. $500 of it is from an account that is definitely  over 7 years old so I'm disputing that, the other $250 I'm trying to negotiate paying it off.

About a week ago I start getting calls from random numbers while I'm at work. I figure it must have something to do with the fact that I got a new card and maybe one of the collections is trying to reach out to me. It is a debt collector however they were not attempting to collect either of the accounts in collections. They are trying to collect on an account that was closed in 2019 and is listed on my report as a charge off.

I'm still trying to learn the lingo and it's all so confusing. To me it seems like an account that is not in collections, charged off and closed would no longer be something that they can collect on right? I've read about pay for deletes and things like that, does that apply to all derogatory marks on my history?

I guess my biggest concern is raising my score so the question is. If it's already a derogatory mark on my credit and it's not in collections what would be the point of paying the debt unless they were to remove it from my credit? And does a third party even have the ability to remove a charge off? 

Please help I'm reading everything I can but it's like they have so many overlapping terms for all this credit stuff and I don't truly understand what they mean.",1647555512.0

Weird situation and we don't want to be an ostrich, so would love some insight. My wife has been getting debt collection calls from Sequium Asset Solutions, no voicemails. We actually missed them entirely because Verizon now automatically blocks them since the numbers are registered as spam. But Googling them makes it seem like they are a legitimate debt collection agency. She noticed the same number has called 2-3 times over the month and found Sequium Asset Solutions.

I read the [debt collection guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/nqlj6u/how_to_deal_with_collections_complete_guide/) (which is awesome), but my question is, we pulled her credit report and my credit report to see if there was anything on there. There's not. Everything is clean on all 3 bureaus, nothing in default, there should be no reason they're calling. 

I would love your advice, but our current options seem to be

1. Ignore them, they're getting blocked anyway
2. Answer, record, and get the address for a debt validation letter
3. This is actually spam.

What do you think? Whatever it is, it's not on any of the 3 credit reports.",1647554775.0
533,Score took a sudden plunge/ Is it safe to be added to my sisters card to raise score?,1,tgmzqg,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tgmzqg/score_took_a_sudden_plunge_is_it_safe_to_be_added/,4,"Hello all,

I’ve been trying to turn my credit around over the past 2 years. I’ve seen about 200 points in growth and have been holding steady around 720 for the past few months, growing about 1 to 2 points every few weeks and topping out recently at 730. I have a few credit cards with a total credit limit of 9000, and I’ve been keeping my utilization below 5%. I’ve also been paying interest on my student loans, not on the loans themselves due to the freeze. 

Recently my score suddenly dropped 38 points. Credit Karma and Experian didn’t give me any reasons as to why, but Credit Sesame gave two reasons.. 1. The date that you opened your oldest account is too recent. 2. Lack of sufficient relevant real estate account information. 

Does anyone know what thats about? I’ve been diligent about staying on top of factors that affect my credit, so I was a little blindsided by this. Is there anyone I can call to ask about this? I’m considering talking to one of those credit defense agencies, if it might be some type of error. 

I’m getting ready to move to a new state in a  few months and would like to have my credit as high as possible while shopping for apartments. I’m considering asking two of my sisters to add me to one of their oldest credit cards to raise my credit limit and credit age, and hopefully my score. Before I even ask them I have to know, is there any possible way them adding me a card would hurt their score. I’m learning credit is a very finicky, unpredictable beast. Once they add me, I would have the card delivered to their homes and destroyed, to ease any worry of me spending on the card. This would be performative of course, since we both know I would never go spending on their card. Id hope to stay on their cards for about a year, and I do realize that any growth I may have seen will fall off once I’m removed.

I currently have $2,850 in available credit across 4 cards, no student or auto loans (medical suspension of license, so won't need an auto loan). Of that ~$300 is utilized currently, but I just paid that off today.

I am paying a massive hospital bill right now, so cash flow is tighter than usual. Shouldn't fall behind on those, but worth mentioning in case anyone has ideas to kill 2 birds with one stone, but I don't want to jump the gun on anything, of course.

Most of the card offers I get are for some unreliable junk, and I already fell for 1 card with Genesis FS & refuse to ever get one with them again. I bank through Discover with 2 years good standing, so thinking it may be good to apply for a Discover Card?

Does anyone have the name & title of a human being at Capital One to address a goodwill request to? Alternatively, some have mentioned emailing the request/letter... is there an email address you can share?

My situation: I had a ""very high"" credit score and maintained a zero balance on my emergency Cap One card until I missed their annual $19 charge and subsequent late charges. Suddenly my score dived 100 points, so I logged in to CapOne to find out what was going on. I immediately paid it off and am back to a zero balance.

After the 2008 crash my score was very low and I spent years getting it back up. It is infuriating that a $19 charge can tank a score when compared with years of cards, mortgages, car payments etc. being made with no late payments... but that's the scam system we have. ANYWAY, any opinions on whether that gives me a better or worse chance of being granted a goodwill amendment? In my letter I made very sure to take total responsibility for my mistake and be gracious and polite. I also let them know I set up autopay, balance/payment due alerts, and that am putting the annual charge on my calendar as well, and I plan to enclose the pages of my credit report showing my perfect payment record on this card until now, my other card with them, and all other accounts for the last however long shows up on there.

I’m planning to build credit by applying for multiple credit cards. Unfortunately, I messed up big time and my credit score reduced from 725 to 644 (FICO). What happened was, I raised my credit to 725 using my Chase Freedom Student account and closed the only credit card account I had when I applied for my freedom flex card (lesson learned! never again!). However, my Flex Card hasn’t been updated on my credit report but my student card has been updated as closed. Hence, currently my report shows 1 closed account and 0 open accounts.

If anyone dives deep into my credit report and check my closed account history, they’ll find that I’ve had 0 late payments and a credit utilization always under 10%.

I am writing this out of frustration from the credit system. I am in my mid thirties and always had a great credit score(760+). My wife and I earn good money(350k+) and have multiple cards. We always pay our balances in full 💯 of the time.

 We were travelling last year internationally and unfortunately I caught COVID and forgot to pay a bill of only $90 on one of my credit cards for 2 months as I forgot to setup auto-pay on it. I got to know when I recovered but by that time the Bank had closed my credit card and filed a delinquency on my credit card. I paid the money immediately at that point but my credit score took a dive and went into early 600s. Since then I have made the right payments, opened new cards at safe intervals, took a few repair loans but even then my credit has just inched to 690s. 

The problem is that now we want to buy a house. We are  in California (Bay area) and the price of homes is high which means that I am not able to get approval for enough mortgage because of less than 700 credit score. Even If I do, I am getting very high rates with high down-payment and reserve requirements. This will cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars more over the lifetime of mortgage.

I have written to the bank about the situation and really requested them to remove this from my credit report. I am not sure if that will work. I am looking for any advice or pointers that might help me in this situation.

Offcourse I am utterly frustrated with this unjust system. I am a permanent resident and moved to the US about 5 years ago. Why is the credit system and algorithms so unjust and stupid as to not take into account even the amount of a late payment vs how much I spend every month and pay taxes. $90 freaking bucks over 1 month due to forgetfulness is causing me so much financial burden so as to cost me hundreds of thousands. Why don't the people in US talk about this utter stupid calculation. Why is the amount of late-payment/debt vs earning not taken into account. Why is there no ratio calculated. Even when a person earns respectable amount of money, he can really be treated like shit for not paying freaking $90 for 2 months!!?  Is there no legal way to contest this anywhere? Don't enough people in this country suffer from this absolutely shitty and biased system?",1647469642.0

All my post will mostly stay on the topic of credit repair to stay in posting guidelines of this forum. 

I’ll try to keep it short, and sweet with 100% transparency (probably going to end up being long). I’m a 26-year-old male that’s starting a new job in the tech industry as a Engineer. I’ll be making 105k with 10% bonus at the end of the year. This will what I consider my first “major” job as the previous job was 1099 work, I did make about 35k doing that, and before that was retail sales where I was making about 47k. I only left the retail job to do 1099 work because I needed experience in order to get the role I’m fortunate enough to now have. I made some mistakes in my early 20’s such as running up credit cards, and not being able to pay them off resulting in them being sent to collections or being charged off. I’m working on getting that all fixed up by submitting letters for Pay for Delete, Debt Verification or Goodwill Letters all of that is something I’m working with Credit Boards forums to improve my credit score to remove as much negatives I can. Another thing I know I screwed up on is not starting a 401k with my previous retail employer where they were matching up to 5%, to be honest I was living pay check to pay check before, and never really understood 401k stuff or bothered with it. I’ll make a list below outlining where I stand with current expenses, and some details followed by questions I’m seeking answers for in order to guide me down the right path this time.

Calvary Portfolio Services had a credit card of mine in collections. On their website they say that when they close their accounts (either paid in full or settled) they request that the item be deleted from your credit report. 

That struck me as a great way for a CA to get people to agree to pay anything. They don't guarantee it is deleted, so they could very likely not try at all but say they did. Or they could honestly try and rope people in with success stories. Either way, the carrot is there to draw you in.

I was going to try to settle no matter what because I need a short term boost to my score. So I called and negotiated a settlement. When it came time for info about deleting, the agent I was speaking to told me they could not put it in writing that they would ask for a delete. He said the templates for their written agreements were already set and couldn't be changed but they do request the items be deleted.

I conceded and agreed to pay thinking there was a big chance I was not going to have it deleted and lo and behold within a week or two it was off my Experian report (haven't checked the other yet).

I'm new to this subreddit but I've been reading a few posts and it turns out that a lot of people have gotten good advice from here. So it inspired me to do this post. 

First of all I want to introduce myself. My name is Adam and I'm currently 26 years old with around $13k of debt. My FICO score is around 480 and it's all due to my bad decisions I'm not going to sugar coat anything. My first credit card was from Wells Fargo with a $500 limit that was when I was around 21 years of age. I used to hear and there and I knew the basics of having to pay it off on time. Did that for about a few months and it did help my score go up. I was getting invitations to credit cards left to right. I was also enrolled in school at the time and I wanted a new computer. $500 wasn't going to get me the computer I wanted so I decided to open up a Best buy credit card. I got accepted with a 2k limit. I got the computer I wanted and paid it off. So I thought that I had good credit card habits for about a year and a half. I was working a part-time job and on my third year of school I had no financial aid. So all the money I had to spend was my part time job. I thought that's when things started to go downhill. Me having pride and wanted to do things on my own I didn't want to ask my parents for help. My part-time job money while it helped it wasn't enough. So that's when I started using my CCs. My thought process was I'll use my CCs to buy and pay for stuff I need and then pay off with my job money. Yeah that didn't work out. My spending on my CC's far exceed what I can really pay. I did try keeping it to essential items only but as naive college student that knew nothing about credit I also splurged on items I didn't need. I was able to keep paying the minimum but seeing how much interested I was racking up discouraged me. 
So I ended up using this company called Tally. I put all my debit into that account and that was around $5k. So all my debit was all consolidated into this tally account. You would think I'll just focus and pay that off but no. I kept using my credit cards as well and again I was in debit. Not only did I have to pay Tally $5k but I had my Best Buy credit  around $2.9k and an Amazon Chase card for $3k I don't even know how I managed to do that.

 I kept paying the minimum on everything until 2020. When COVID impacted my work. At that time I had a full-time job and was making decent money. I was able to pay off what I could but the interested in all my cards was to high it felt I wasn't doing anything just keeping my credit score from dropping ever so slightly. Then around the end of 2020 I lost my job. That was around November and that's when it really just went to shit. I wasn't able to get to pay anything on time. I was trying to get a job left to right but I didn't get any calls back. I was jobless for about 4 months. I didn't pay any of my debt during that time and they all went to collection and got charged off. 

I tried filing for Bankruptcy but my parents found out and they discouraged me from doing it. They said I had to man up and fix this myself and not choose the easy way. So I didn't go through with it.

Now I'm at a point where im not sure what to do. What should I tackle on first? I've used Chimes Cr for builder but I'm not sure if that is going to help a ton. At this point I'm so lost. Should I try to settle all the debits? Should I try Bankruptcy again? Or do I let them age out? 

I'm 26 and I can't believe I let my credit go down this bad. I have plans for the future like marrying my current gf and I just feel all that has to be put on hold because of my mistakes. So if someone can please tell me what they did or how would they go about it I'll appreciate it.

This story is all over the place a lot of things were left out but I feel like I would write a whole three page essay just explain everything in detail. So I apologize if things don't make sense.",1647475126.0

Long story short
Years ago I rehabbed mt defaulted student loan 
When my broker pulled my credit my old defaulted student loan is still showing up 
I know as a fact it was successfully rehahbed 
It doesn't show up for me on credit karma as a collection anymore
I called the loan servicer and they said my account is in good standing.
They told me to call default resolution group
DRG told me I have a zero balance and I should be all good
DRG told me I should open a dispute with the bureau so they can investigate and correct it
I have no idea what to do or If a dispute is even a good idea
How is this even possible if all the relevant parties are telling me im all good why would the bureau have such old information, like two years old at this point.


Full context

Okay so, like the title says. I had a defaulted student loan from when times were tougher in my life years ago. At one point a couple years ago I decided to get it on track so I called and set everything up to rehabilitate my loan. 10 months later or so I got an email or something to that effect letting me know that my loan was out of default and in good standing. Cool, so fast forward to recently. My wife and I are looking for a house, and while talking to our lender to get pre approval they pulled my credit and apparently my defaulted student loan is still showing up for them. This confused me, because from everything I can see on credit karma they just show up as ""student loans"" and they're no longer listed as collections. I'm pretty sure my score went up at the point when they were rehabbed as well, but it was awhile ago. So I got on the phone with my loan servicer and they said my account is in good standing, it's currently in forbearance because of the govt pause on student loan payments but the secondary status is that pending the end of the forbearance it will re-enter repayment. Also, that I have auto payments set up despite the forbearance because I opted to continue paying anyway. So I got proof of that sent to me and showed it to the financer and they said okay great. When it came time to check my credit for a different mortgage product obviously it's STILL showing up as in default, despite there having been yet another month and another report to the bureaus that it's in good standing and no longer in default. So I called my servicer again and had them look at my account in as much detail as possible and they said there's literally nothing there showing it as being in default or anything other than what I've already said. They told me that they don't actually report the defaulted status of any loans as a servicer, and that when a loan goes into default it's handed off to default resolution group, gov and then he gave me a wrong number to some literal random man's cell phone. I found the actual number from the govt website and called them. The guy I spoke to there said that I am showing a zero balance and that from what he can see everything looks good as if after being rehabilitated it was transferred back to the servicer as it should have been. He said that because they don't hold the loan anymore they don't report anything to the credit bureaus on my account. I'm extraordinarily confused about this. Can anyone explain what in the world is going on here? I would really like to get pre-approved for a house and this is a dead in the water deal breaker for approval, and I thought I had done everything I was supposed to do to fix it years ago. 
My thought its possible that the servicer doesn't report to whatever specific bureau my financer uses but I haven't heard back from him yet and this is pretty urgent to me.",1647482923.0

Part of my inquiry is based on some new facts of what I’ve read on this sub. 

I had a health crisis back in 2016, combined with never making enough anyway at a job I had been at 10 years, I got in some real trouble.  I wound up racking up almost 6k of a 10k limit on an AMEX.  

Incredibly, AMEX is still holding this debt to this day.  They never sold it. My last payment would have been 2016.. 2017 at the very latest.  Now, the emails they send every-other-day state that can no longer sue for the debt—- it’s  past the statute of limitations.

Also, I can’t find this debt on my Experian  report.  If a bad debt falls off after 7 years, If I either settle with them or…. As I feel is the better thing —- pay it in full —am I just throwing away money for something that’s not even on my credit??

Same timeline.  I have back rent from an a corporate apartment community due.  Just over $5,000.  This is reporting, but they stopped collecting on it pretty much  a year ago.  This was March 2017 first missed payment.  I’m about two years from bad debt falling off 

I am going to need to sign a lease in the next 12-18 months, and I want to raise my credit.  I’m at 567 right now. Awful. 

I am thinking people will say here, pay the bad debt to the apartment as good faith. 

But then they always say, paying collections does nothing for your score.

Short of saving up $10k and paying off both in full so I get a paid in full on my he credit report,  what are the next best moves here putting my future first ?",1647483281.0

The vehicle has been on autopay (authorized for the life of the loan). We checked in February and each of our scores had dropped by over 50 points.  Our auto finance company showed a late payment. I immediately called the finance company and they told me I’d have to dispute it (very frustrating, but a different conversation). 

We are in the process of buying a home and in order to qualify, we needed a score of 720 or better (which we had). Our close date was initially 120 days out from our first credit pull so we knew another credit pull was coming. 

I filed disputes with the credit bureaus on the grounds that we approved the auto payments for the life of the loan so this was an issue with their card system.  The disputes were received on February 12 (31 days ago). 

For anyone wondering, we put all of our bill money in a separate checking account + 10% extra, we very rarely check this account as we have never had an issue like this in 10+ years.  The finance company sent a letter that 23 had missed a payment. The letter was dated 1/20 and postmarked two weeks later on the 2/4 (already 30 days late).

I plan to pay down this city double cash card significantly in the coming months as this is still active in my credit report.

My worry is if/when paid in full they will just immediately close the account and my credit history/ account history would take a hit. I was thinking I could pay it down so low that the interest wouldn’t be that big of a deal and make the small payments. The positive of this is that I could artificially make my utilization numbers look good for a brief period while shopping for a car loan. I can’t use this card and will likely never be issued another citi card although they said I could technically reapply for  another one. Doubt I will have any luck there though.

Thoughts from any folks in this community?  I have no reason to think this will stay open for long but maybe long enough to have an okay impact on my credit.

Already have Discover secured card (and have graduated to unsecured)

I'm in need of advice, CRedditors.

I am in my mid-20s. When I was just barely out of high school (\~18 yo), I had a medical procedure with a hefty bill that insurance should have covered but didn't, at first. After a lot of calls, my parent finally got insurance to cover the majority of it, but there was still a remaining amount of about $100 billed to us. My parent refused to pay that bill, and it was sent to collections. It has been on my credit report since 2016 and will not be removed until mid-2023.

Back in 2018 when my parent helped me apply for a few credit cards (I think 3 over the course of 1-1.5 years or so, I don't remember exactly), I got denied for every single one. My parent (who has a long and healthy credit history) even co-signed for another application with me in 2019, and we still got denied. I spoke with my other parent about this in 2020, and they prompted me to check my credit score and that is when I found out about the collection. This is the only negative entry on my credit reports from all 3 bureaus. I pay all of my bills (CC and other) on time in full and have never had a loan of any kind. My FICO score is around 660/670, though I did just get denied for another credit card that I applied for with my spouse, so that will probably be taking a hit due to the hard pull.

Until this most recent denial, I honestly kind of forgot about the collection because my parent told me there wasn't much I could do to get the collection removed. I know my first step is likely to try to pay that bill and ask for a goodwill deletion given the situation (I was 18 and was not really in charge of my own finances), but that could be unsuccessful. My question is, **how can I still build up my credit in the meantime while waiting for the collection to be removed?**

I got a secured card through Discover last year and have used it responsibly (I think I've technically graduated to unsecured). I am also an authorized user on some older accounts, giving me a good length of credit history. My spouse and I are hopefully planning to buy a house within the next 2-5 years, so I know I will need good credit to help improve our chances of getting a mortgage. All of the other secured cards available seem pretty meh compared to the Discover one, but maybe there's one you recommend?",1647354234.0

612,Collection letter that validated debti.,1,tekz58,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tekz58/collection_letter_that_validated_debti/,2,"II recently got a letter from a collection agency for a medical debt through the VA. The collection letter provided me with a link to pay the OC through the OC website, (it is the government website for the VA) which I did. 

The collection letter also stated I had 30 days to dispute the debt through them. If i did they cannot report it to the credit bureau until thru provided period off said debt. 

I'm paid the debt through the government website after I got the collection letter, but before I sent a validation letter.

Today I received a letter from the collection agency proving the debt. (Date of service, medication copay numbers. Etc). 

The letter states that as of March 4 I owe $x amount. I paid the debt on the 10th and sent a certified letter on the 13th. 

Did I screw this up? Are they going to report this as a paid collection on my report. 

The collection agent I spoke to on the phone said they don't report because they are not the owner of the debt. That comes rom the furnished. They were just assigned the debt, they did not purchase the debt so they don't report.

Do I have to now provide the collection agency proof that I paid the debt before the date they gave me to dispute the debt?",1647336210.0

&#x200B;

A few years ago, we lived in a condominium that utilized Spectrum to provide internet. Upon moving out, we were told to leave all Spectrum-related equipment for pick up. A few months after moving out, my friend received a call from collections due to an unreturned router. Obviously, we were long gone and had no way of ever finding it.

When my friend asked the debt collector if paying the fee for the router would remove the collections, the agent told them no.

I have had credit cards now for 16 years. I have a perfect payment history and no late payments. The cards I got that long ago were the introductory cards where the interest rate is exorbitant and you often start out owing the bank money. Yet I persisted and over time, I got extensions on my limit. Payments were always on time and above the minimum. 

Right now I’m sitting on a 711 Equifax score. I have total available credit of $17,500. 

My cards are (limit/debt)
Capital One Visa $4500/$4200
Capital One MC $1300/$1100
Truist Visa $7500/$0
Guitar Center (Synchrony) $2500/$1175
Synchrony Car Care $800$30
Dental Care Credit $1000/$50

I just got the Truist card and was thinking of moving over the Capital One cards because the interest is 28%. But the banker suggested a loan instead, said I had a good score and payment history and he couldn’t see why I wouldn’t be approved. We worked it out for a 5 year/$241 payment per month. I’m currently paying between $275-$350 a month depending on how much I’m making and overtime. 

I’ve been at my job for seven years and make $42K a year and have a strong debt to income ratio, and my CC utilization is only 38%. 

I know individuals with less income, shorter credit histories, lower scores, and late payments that were able to get installment loans. So I don’t get why I was declined.

The guy at the bank said the reason given was that I had too much credit card debt. Well duh. I agree that it’s too much which is why I wanted to consolidate. I’m fully capable of making the loan payments. My history shows that I can manage my debt.

The banker says I should just do the balance transfer for the Capital One cards and pay them down so it tot debt is under $5000. Fine. But I still don’t understand why I’m such a bad risk with everything I have in my favor. It’s a little insulting.",1647291013.0
617,So frustrated,2,tedi9j,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tedi9j/so_frustrated/,8,"Hi everyone. Until recently, my credit had been over 800 for as long as I can remember. I had never missed a payment and I hdlad never had a balance.

Several months ago, I had a ""Bank A"" credit card that was affiliated with a company. The card had solid benefits and I had it for many years. I always paid in full every month and never have had a balance on any card I own. 

Bank A ended its affiliation with the company and ""Bank B"" took over the card. I never activated the Bank B card because the benefits changed. I also moved to a different town at around the same time. 

I eventually received a forwarded bill from Bank B to my new address with a notice that the payment was late. It was nominal amount (under $30) and I called and paid it, explaining that I had moved and didn't even know I owed Bank B anything. 

A week or two later, I got a notice from my local bank that my credit score had dropped due to the 30 day late notice that Bank B put on my credit report. From over 800, it went down to the low 600s! (This number is from a Chase service called Credit Journey, which I believe is a FICO score.) The score went up after Bank B reported that I paid the past due amount, but it's still almost 100 points lower than it was (and I believe still should be).

Here's the kicker. With the benefits I had accrued from the card, Bank B actually owed me a multiple of what I owed them! (And they still haven't paid me.)

I wrote Bank B and explained the situation. They refused to change the report. I disputed it with Experian, but Bank B again refused to change it. I don't know what to do next, so thought I'd ask here. Thanks very much for any advice!",1647308349.0

They documented the wrong insurance information and sent me down a year long fight to get each collection rebilled to my insurance correctly. Unfortunately, this meant that many of these healthcare agencies sent my debt to collections. After fighting to get them taken off and properly billed, I thought I was in the clear. Think again, one credit agency failed to bill my insurance in time with my insurance mandatory 12-month bill period from time of service. I called them almost exactly 11 months after I was seen and spoke to their rep, giving them all of the correct insurance information to bill them correctly. I was assured they would bill my insurance, and that was that. Fast forward over a month later, they still had not billed my insurance. This unfortunately meant that they no longer met the 12-month billing requirement to have it covered under my insurance. My insurance says they can't do anything for me. My question is, what are my options? Is there any way to deal with this that means I won't have to cover this bill out of pocket? The amount is $1200. They clearly dropped the ball on this and failed to bill my insurance in a timely manner.",1647198365.0

They cancelled the lawsuit when I signed a document agreeing to these terms.

I paid that amount for the next 12 months, which obviously didn't come close to paying off the debt. Jan 2021 I was unemployed again, so I stopped paying on it and haven't paid them since.

Two questions about [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) and then follow up questions.

I'm wanting to increase my credit. And I don't want to sign up for these other predatory type of credit card companies.

1. For [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) can I have a 0 balance on this account and it still report the $1500 credit line to the 3 bureaus as long as I don't close the account? Or is this like a secured card I need to always have a balance in there for the card to be active?
2. If I open the account what happens to my age of history and if I close this account what happens to my age of history?

Are there companies similar to [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) or cards that I can use that don't do a hard inquiry and have no annual fees or MONTHLY fees? Credit One and First Premier have both of these issues.

My worry is I currently have 10 years age of history. If I start getting a few of these cards and I want to wean off of them in the future when I start getting better card offers how will this affect my age of history for my accounts?

I'm also wondering if [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) is known by creditors as a type of ""hack"" and could this hurt me in anyway if lenders knew what [Cred.ai](https://Cred.ai) was. ",1647172963.0
652,Disputed Collections Disappeared?,3,tcyq1b,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tcyq1b/disputed_collections_disappeared/,9,"So there was a recently-reported collections for me from the fall of 2014 with my college, which I had to withdraw from, but after you're allowed to drop classes, and so they still charged me. I never made any payments, since I felt I shouldn't have owed it, due to having to withdraw due to circumstances outsi6of my control.

I did some research because I wasn't certain of what year it was for when I saw it on my credit report, but did confirm that it was for the fall of 2014, and my college also confirmed the due date for payment was August 1st, 2014.

I tried disputing it through requesting verification of dates or whatever on Experian (figured I would start with just them and plan a different tact with the others depending on the results), and within a day or two, it was supposedly verified as accurate. 

I then basically just disputed it again, but on all 3 agencies (which still apparently is not complete). I attached a screenshot of the email I received from my college stating what was said above. I know that's probably not a binding document, but it was all I could get - they sent correspondence in the mail, but after so long, I couldn't wait to at least try.

I had emailed my college and was clear about why I was disputing, and they said they would forward my communication to the collection agency and have them reach out to me, send something to me, etc.

Then the very next day, I notice the collection doesn't appear to be showing up anymore on either TransUnion or Equifax -- it was never on Experian, so I'm now showing 0 collections suddenly, across the the board. 

So, I guess my question is, is it possible for a collection to just temporarily disappear while in dispute? Or did the collection agency just realize their error and stealthily remove it? I know you can't say the latter for sure, but I won't even have time to call them until Wednesday or Thursday at the earliest, with my work schedule.

I checked the Wells Fargo app and looked at my credit score and it still said 760 as of March 2nd. I checked there and it said no recent inquires which is confusing because I just got an auto loan. Isn’t that an inquiry?

Made some foolish decisions years ago after having an emergency surgery and using my CC to stay afloat after losing my employment due to the recovery time that are costing me at the moment. I am in a good financial place and would like to be more responsible moving forward. We currently rent an apartment in NYC and want to purchase a home in a rural area so our son has a backyard to play in and does not grow up in the inner city.

Credit Cards:

• Discover IT - Account in good standing, opened in 2018, have not missed any payments. Balance currently $0.

• Capital One Secured - Account in good standing, opened 2018, 4 late payments worst is 60-89 days late.

• Chase Freedom Unlimited - Account was closed in February 2020, opened July 2018, 8 times late worst payment 120-180 days late. I have regularly been making on time payments that have been reported to the bureaus. I've had over 12 on time payments since it was closed.

• Capital One Quicksilver - Account closed on September 2019, opened May 2017, this account was charged off, credit report does not show any payment history, just that it was charged off and the full balance is owed. I know this account was sold to a recovery company but that has not shown on any report.

Collections:

• Two medical bills for an emergency surgery I had in 2018, collections accounts where opened in 2019. I have disputed the information but was unsuccessful.

• I paid off two collections for the same time period, they were low amounts, and the two were updated to paid in full status.

Student Loans:

• I have an open account that has over 36 on time payments, no late payments.

Other Loans:

• I have a current Auto Loan since May 2021 no late payments

• My old Auto Loan had a 4 late payments reported.

Current Scores:

Fico 8: 545, 592, 562

Fico 5, 4 ,2: 519, 507, 545

These scores are from 2/24/22, I have dropped cc usage from 87% to 0%, and paid off the two collections mentioned above after those scores where generated so I will update the scores once they refresh at the end of the month.

For record I have a Apple card(Mastercard) 4,000 CL. Wells Fargo active cash(visa) 3,000 CL. My first basic card Capital One(Mastercard) 1,000 CL. Also I have a Wells Fargo and a local credit union checking/savings account. 

Should I open up a Amex card Since I just opened the Apple and Wells fargo Active Cash in the last month. So I’m wondering if I should open an Amex card even though I’ll get dinged in credit now I figure it’ll help get the ball rolling when I’ll actually need credit in 3-5 years. And should I just pick the one with no yearly fee? 

Credit score in the last four months went from 646 to 696(Credit Karma) and up from 646 to 810(Experian) also should I ask for an increase in my CL for the Capital one at 1,000 or is it to early since this month will be my five months on owning that card even though my credit score jumped so high. 

Last question is just using those two apps enough to follow my credit? I know experian and credit karma follow different branches I guess of credit history. Should I have another app to follow the third bureau or does it matter and those will be enough.

Mobile user. I am turning 31 in May and hope to try for my first child when I am 33 (2024). I have several big financial goals that I would like to accomplish or get as close to accomplishing before I start family planning more seriously. If all were to go according to plan, that gives me 2 years to complete these. 

1. Purchasing a home: ideally, I would like I start this process sooner rather than later. Mortgages take a long time to pay off. I was considering house hacking for a bit before the baby comes, and that would only really be helpful if I purchased soon. I live in Texas and houses here are generally 300K+. My city has a first time home buyer's down payment assistance program. Long story short: I would qualify for this assistance on my own, but not with my bf's added income. So I was considering purchasing the house on my own. However, while my income is more, his credit score is higher than mine so would probably qualify for a better loan with him added. Would it make more sense to do a conventional loan with less down so we can apply together vs purchasing with my credit alone to take advantage of the down payment assistance? I think the general advice is to wait until your credit is at 640 to get a mortgage, but I want to know what my options are as far as purchasing a home asap. Any advice for raising my credit as quickly? 

2. Bachelor's degree: this is where it gets interesting. I recently took out a personal loan of 3,800 for the first semester of school. I havent actually paid the school as enrollment is wrapping up now. However, now I am questioning if I should have waited to take out this 3,800 personal loan until after I got the mortgage. My plan is to pay off the 3,800 over the next 6 months, then get another 3,800 loan to finish out the degree plan. I'm just realizing that this plan will likely impact my ability to qualify for a mortgage. Should I simply pay off this personal loan right away, get the mortgage, then start school afterwards? Or is it too late since there is now a new account on my credit report? If I had to choose one or the other, I'd probably choose to purchase the home before the degree. We are also planning to get married, but both dont want to have a wedding. So no huge financial burden there. 

My credit score: 593
My yearly gross income: 42,000
Student loans in default: 15,000 (am planning to start payment plan within next few months)
Credit optimization:  24% and working on getting it lower
I have a few medical paid collections that I'm waiting to fall off my report as well 

Bf's credit score: 717
Bf's yearly gross income: 33,000
Has a car payment, but no other debts that I know of
We currently rent together

AmEx does an initial inquiry if it's your first card, often none after that and no reporting.  Chase will pull your personal credit for each business card applied for, but not report.  

Other banks (e.g: Capital One) both pull personal reports and report to personal reports.  I'm not really in the market for C1 or similar behaving business cards.

Also, building a business credit score/report via vendor Net30 accounts, store-specific business cards (Lowes, Home Depot), etc clearly don't report to personal reports, as that's how you build a D&B score, Business Experian, etc.

###My question is...

...when you apply for a personal mortgage, car loan, or other financing through AmEx, Chase, or other lender *that you have a business card through*, will they add that data into consideration, or would they strictly go off your Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion credit files...which may have inquiries, but don't show the accounts?

During that time I let some other, less prevalent to survival bills fall to the wayside.

Miraculously I was able to pull together a good commision month and have about 8k coming in on my next check which after monthly expenses leaves me with around 6.5k to spare.

694,Regarding removal of consecutive charge-offs,1,tbz5tl,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tbz5tl/regarding_removal_of_consecutive_chargeoffs/,2,"Crazy story. On August 2021, I got my first car lease through a broker who made the lease agreement with Volvo Car Financial Services, and thought that I had established auto-pay for paying everything off monthly. Indeed, my credit score shows that the first payment was paid in full.

That month, I was also unfortunately the victim of identity theft, and my paranoia led to me completely ignoring any unrecognized phone numbers.

Fast-forward to about a month ago. I was completely unaware of what had been happening, and eventually ended up picking a Volvo phone call telling me my car has been marked for repossession the past 3 months, and that the account has been closed. Even though I could easily pay the loan, I could not easily afford to pay the whole car amount.

Luckily, the car was never repossessed, and I was able to work with my broker to settle the payment internally. However, now I have 3 late payments, and 3 consecutive charge-offs marked on my credit report (6 negative months in total).

Is having 3 charge-offs marked on my account correct? Should it not just be 1?

My main question is what steps I can take to try and get this all removed? This was all ignorance on my part not knowing I hadn't been paying off my loan. It's also frustrating because during this whole time, I received absolutely no emails from them, and Volvo caller IDs are purposely marked unknown for some reason. The funny thing is they started calling WAY more once I had finally picked up. They also do not even support emails, only faxes. It was just such a traumatizing experience altogether.

I know everyone in this sub recommends figuring out how to place removals on your own, but I wouldn't mind paying someone or a service either.

What would you do?

I relocated to a small city for work about 5 years ago and decide to rent (not buy) a place to live as I did not expect to live here long (covid turned my 3 year max tenure into a 5 year tenure). About 2 years into my stay I was gifted a puppy (ok, more like he was thrust upon me, but he's been great) who needed a yard so I decided to end my lease and find a home instead. Two days prior to my move [it snowed in Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9317,_2021_North_American_winter_storm#Central_and_Southern_Plains) pretty badly which caused a huge backlog with my movers. Through tough negotiation and pleading with the moving company they were able to get to me a few days after the snow cleared up and due to the timing I had to reach out to the leasing office to let them know that I would need an extra day due to everything that happened. However, due to said weather they were not in office into the day of the move and but luckily I was able to get their approval for the extension (I even got it in writing). Fast Forward roughly 6 months and a collection agency reaches out to me stating I owe the equivalent of one month's rent and they are uncompromising when I try to engage them and explain how that's not true. They stated because I stayed an additional day in the property I was liable for the entire month's rent. When I provide my payment history and any supporting documentation (including the leasing offices approval)  they just provide a standard lease agreement with my name on it (no signature or endorsement) as their proof that I owe the debt. When I engaged the CRA for support they just initiated a standard dispute in which that same piece of paper was provided and then they certified it as valid. I'm very frustrated as I have a perfect pay history and no account on my credit report has ever been late (open or closed). This might be another reason why they are being uncompromising to me as they know how important having good credit is to me.

I quickly got behind on the payments and thought I was screwed until chase, who I already bank with, offered to buy out the card and in turn I would take out a 60 month loan with interest and pay it off in installments on auto draft. For 6 months I noticed the $59 go out of my account and soon forgot about it thinking it would take care of itself until I could make larger payments and take care of it. Yesterday I get a notification on my credit karma app that informs me I have taken a 77 point hit on my credit for lack of payment on that loan. I quickly call chase who directs me to their credit bureau where I’m told that I missed payments for February and march and that there was nothing he could do to help with the credit hit even if I squared up the payments with him. He also told me they had sent out a letter but made no attempt to reach me by phone or email. I had assumed that my account was delinquent on the first of both those months because of rent and that was the reason that the payment wasn’t auto drafted but after reviewing my statements I found that I had had enough money every month ready to be withdrawn. I also found that an auto draft had been made in December(2021) and February but not January or march, even though on the first of both months I had sufficient funds in my account. I called my local chase to see if they would help but the gentleman advised that I contact the number on the back of my Amazon card. I call the number and find out that they had an old address still associated with that card even though I had updated my chase information after moving the time before my most recent move( feb. 22) we clear that up and then talk about my auto draft date and change that to the middle of the month as well as pay up on the outstanding balance on the account. He then transfers me back to the credit bureau to talk about my credit hit and to see if this simple mistake can be resolved. I tell the man that I was on auto draft payments but for whatever reason the payments weren’t drafted even though I had sufficient funds in my account, he then told me that I am on manual payments and that it was clearly my fault that a payment wasn’t made. I tell him all over again that the account was in auto draft and he clearly doesn’t believe me and that the only option I have is to fax their correspondence department with a cover sheet and documentation that will take over two weeks to even get reviewed. Obviously angry and discouraged I’m just wondering if anyones been through anything similar and if this fight is even worth it. I should also note that in the first phone call I was told I could make payments through my chase app but could not find where after the call had ended. When my account was open there was my credit card section under my checking and savings account but the Amazon card account disappeared as soon as I began their liquidation program. It seems like a simple mistake on their end but they refuse to take responsibility and the hit on my credit was larger than the actual payment..Thank you in advance for feedback",1647018444.0

I paid this bill and now I come to out that this was not the actual bill. This was a bill sent from the doctor who gave me service rather than the actual hospital, which to me makes no sense but you guys know how annoying medical bills are. Anyways fast forward about 2 years and I find out that I actually have an outstanding account with said hospital for 1100 dollars. I was informed of this account about a month after treatment by email in 2021 but like I said I was sent a bill for basically the same amount with what my insurance had paid, I only had to pay about 100 dollars after insurance. I believed that this bill was the one for the hospital because it had the name of the hospital as the entity charging me. It is until now about 2 years later that I found out that this actually wasn't the bill for the hospital but for the doctor as I stated above. The problem is that in the hospital account it says ""this account has been placed in collections"" I was never informed of this, I never received any letter or email informing me that this account was placed in collections like I said I believed I had paid it when I received the bill a month after my date of service. anyways after about 3 weeks of going back and forth in a chat with the hospital, I was able to get a collections letter sent to my house with the agency name, phone number, and email on it with the amount owed. My question is how can I keep this from showing up on my credit?

I’ve been trying to get my credit out of the gutter after some mistakes made long ago. I have everything paid off. In late January of this year I answered a call of a collection agency that had been calling non-stop for the past two weeks. I was told this was for a medical bill in October of 2016 and they sent me a written notice. I explained I did not recall that bill (at the time I did not, now I realized what it was for) and I never received a notice from them. The address they gave me was one I had not lived in since October of 2016.

Edit: Upon speaking to them they stated the following (I did record the call)
They sent a notice mid-October 2021 to my apartment in a different state that I moved out of October 31st 2016.
They received that notice back as returned on in late October 2021. They stated they did not attempt to send me anymore notices.
They reported it to the credit bureaus late January 2022 (exactly 90 days after the notice was sent back to them) I asked for a full debt verification letter and they said they will send it within 30 days. This sounds like I should be able to dispute this to me.

~~They managed to find my current phone number which is attached to my current address, but they sent the letter to an old address.~~

I was super pissed, I said send me a notice, if you can find my phone number you also have my current address and hung up.

Three days later the account showed up on my credit report.

I haven’t had the mental strength to deal with this until now. It’s about $2000 and I want a complete written document of all that I owe, but before I call I am wondering if I can send them a letter stating that they never notified me in writing, due to the FDCA they violated my rights, etc etc.

I’ve made LOTS of mistakes with my credit. From student loan default, to unpaid credit cards & medical bills. My FICO score was a 482 in February of last year. 

I started by paying off almost all of my 7 collection accounts (still have 2 and plan on paying them when I have some extra $) and opened a $1,000 secured CC with discover. 

I then enrolled in student loan rehabilitation and started my 9 months in Feb. Luckily the CARES act made it easy for me to rehabilitate without having to add the payment to my budget. 

My score barely budged all year. I went to 516 for a while and stayed there the majority of the year. In November when my student loans were back in good standing I still didn’t see much of an increase. 32 points was all I got. Then Discover closed my account because of paperwork they claimed I was asked to send them (never did) and I didn’t send in time. 

I was sad as hell. With a measly 548 score I had 0 credit cards, student loans that were in good standing but still show the bad history, and 2 lingering collections that I didn’t know when I could pay. I felt defeated. 

I randomly decided to see if I’d qualify for a capital one unsecured card in January. They approved me for $300 and sent it over. I use it responsibly and pay it in full every month. I didn’t know when they reported so at one point my CC use was 99% (I pay my phone bill & gas bill on it every month) — I figured out the day they reported and made sure my balance was $0. 

Today I looked and I’m at 643! My highest credit score in my entire adult life!!!!!! I’m so excited and adamant to get to the 700 club! 

Patience works! I went through a roller coaster of emotions but now that I know as long as I keep trying and being responsible I’ll get there. 

My plan is to pay off the collections, continue using my card responsibly, and stay on top of my student loans.

723,My Experian FIC0 8 credit score is surpassed 700 for the first time in over 2 years.,49,tadoyj,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/tadoyj/my_experian_fic0_8_credit_score_is_surpassed_700/,11,"TL;DR Moral of the story is time, patience, and consistency heals wounds.

If you read post from 2 years ago, I had about $30,000 in credit card debt and 150 days late. 2 of the 3 cards were closed by the bank but no yet forwarded to collections. I had been scammed and swindled by someone close to me. I have always had a near-800 score for 15 years. At its peak, my credit score was 805; at rock bottom,  505. I tried to play off the debt as a natural disaster. It was, after all, right on the onset of COVID-19, but no one at the banks or credit bureaus would loosen their grip. As I have learned from this sub, this delinquency will stay on my credit report for 7 (and a half) years, but its impact will lessen over time.

I was scared, numb, and a 1000 different emotions flowing through me. Once I had paid off the debt, I had to find ways to rebuild credit. With the one card I left, I signed up for secured cards ""credit builders"" Grain and OpenSky with the lowest possible deposits. Grain has been great. OpenSky charges an annual fee and they nickel and dime you so I closed that just before the new annual cycle started.

As I have learned from this sub, there are many different credit scores - VantageScore, FICO 8 nuances, TransUnion this, Equifax that. I realize **Experian FICO 8 is the one true measurement for looking at credit score**. Any other score is just fluff and foam. Each month my credit score would go up a little. It was anguishing to see how little it moved up and how long the score stayed stagnant. Credit score would go up 1 point and stay there for 4 months. Go up 8 points and stay there for 3 months. Go up 6 points and stay there for 5 months, and so on. Once in a while my credit score would jump 40 points, which I assume to be a milestone or annual mark of paying off my debt.

Once I paid off my debt, I kept my one true credit card use to a bare minimum. With $6,000 credit limit, I would use it only to pay for gas. I set autopay and pay off the balance in full each month. My bill averaged $80/mo. I live in an urban suburb so I biked everywhere. I use my debit card for everything else.

So yeah, it's been about 18 months since paying off in full of this roller coaster ride. I went from 505 to 701. It's nice to see the painstaking effort has paid off, however, 700 isn't the end goal. It's simply a means that I'm still not where I am. Best not to sulk about it if you're in no immediate need for credit. I certainly wasn't. I'm lucky to be in that position. There's still a long road ahead to get back to 750+. I do hope I reach that point within the next 2 years. Maybe in 6-7 months from now I might see 730 as that is the two-year mark.

Pay your balance in full each. Use your credit card less than 3% of its limit. Rinse, repeat and tediously wait a few years.

That's it.",1646849084.0

To summarize, I called (NCR was how they referred to themselves) and requested they send me the documentation via USPS verifying:

1. Why they think this was my debt ($1,900+/- for a payday loan that I’m pretty sure I was already garnished for nearly two years ago.  Trying to find that paperwork as well)
2. The date the last payment was made on this account
3. Proof that they were licensed to collect in my state

The guy I spoke to wasn’t rude but verify short, but basically said “I’ll just send a demand letter to your email!”

Naturally if they are able to verify and it’s within the statute for collections I would like to settle this instead of facing a garnishment.  

My questions are:

1. How should I respond to the demand letter?
2. How long legally do I have to respond to this letter before they can take me to court?
3. What options do I have between receipt of the demand letter and my response?

I called their customer service line and got to the credit services department but the CSR was being really difficult and not understanding of the situation at all.

Update:

I called the Macy's credit service group several times and eventually got them to remove the late payment reporting. The trick was to keep trying to explain my situation to different service reps until one was willing to help me out. If a service rep was not willing to help then I thanked them for their time and hung up. Called again and tried again with a different service rep. Keep doing it until someone sympathetic and knowledgeable of the system is willing to help you out.

Don't be discouraged.  Some reps were just not willing to help at all and even being kind of rude.  Just hang up and move onto the next one.

I'm sure that a goodwill letter would be a similar approach but the phone call was a lot faster. Also should note that note all companies do this over the phone and usually require things in writing.

I have a collection account from National Credit Systems from an apartment that I rented for 3 mos in 2016. I was there for work which is why the time was so short. They had a policy of a 60 day move out notice which meant I would have had to give notice the next month after I moved in. I explained that my contract (I am in healthcare and my contract was for 13 weeks) could be extended but they go in 13 week increments. The manager said I could just give 30 notice. 
I gave my 30 day notice and moved out the middle of the last month. In Jan 2017 I received a notice that I owed $1100 from the collection agency. I asked for verification and the collection agency sent me copies of faxed copies of what the apartment said I owed. I have disputed it and it says that in my credit report. Shortly after I moved out the complex was sold and I could not get in touch with the property management agency that owned it while I lived there. The complex said that they had no records of those who lived there before it was sold. The collection agency said I owed 2 weeks rent, repairs to the apt and cleaning. It was in perfect condition when I moved out.
This has affected my ability to rent an apartment as I travel for work. 
I contacted the collection and the person I spoke with said they don’t do a pay for delete. 
If I pay it it will say that in my report but I am wondering if an apartment complex will see that and be able to rent to me.

Wish this was something taught in schools, but credit isn’t really built to incentivize good credit. It is a model to calculate how great the risks are of a person paying you back.
It is supposed to reward those who are naturally great with their debts.

So people go off of scores wayyyyy too often. Although they are important, the info that makes that score is an area that requires more focus.

Have you ever heard, “my Experian score is 750.” That is almost a concise statement. Each credit bureau has credit models that they market to each lender depending on the needs of the lender.
If you have ever heard of “my Fico score,” you have heard of a specific credit model. 3 models off of the top of my head are the Fico Score 8 model, Fico Score 9 model and the Vantagescore 3.0 on Credit Karma.
The models are like a math equation. They are proprietary so don’t even try to guess how they work other than being responsible and having integrity when you sign promissory notes. Your credit info gets fed through these models and out comes a score. Experian, Transunion and Equifax are just companies that market these models. You could have Experian credit score of 750 with the Fico 8 and 700 with the Equifax Fico 9.
The bottom line here is, pay off your debts. (No matter is charged off or past due.) Don’t hire credit counseling companies. Just try your best to pay your bills and being a person that owns his or her promises. With time and just being a very trustworthy lendee, you’ll have a a great credit score.",1646757099.0

I had purchased an expensive travel health insurance and every time I visited the healthcare providers, they checked whether my insurance covered the visit. I was visiting from a country with universal healthcare coverage, so it was all weird to me. Several years later, I am in the USA again and only recently I found out that there are some collections on my credit reports from that time. I never received any notice of these bills, nor did I know that my insurance provider in USA had not paid these bills.

**Details of Collection Records.** In total, there are two collection records, but one of them appears in only one Credit Reporting Agency's (CRA) credit report (CR). The other appears in all three CRA's CRs. The original balance is < $1300 for the first one and < $700 for the second one. Both collections are past California's Statue of Limitations for debts (4 years). Later this year, both collections are due for removal from my Credit Reports.

**Preferred Outcome.** I would like to delete these collections from my credit reports. I understand that they will be deleted in a few months' time but given that it needs another few months to improve my credit score, I would like to get rid of them ASAP. What is the best way to do this? I have read posts (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/nqlj6u/how_to_deal_with_collections_complete_guide/), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/nlriu4/here_is_my_collection_validation_request_process/)) by u/charlesknowes but am unsure about a few things. Any help would be appreciated!

As detailed in the linked posts, I plan to send a letter to the Collection Agencies (CAs) for validation of debt, and another request to CRAs to validate or delete the records.

**My questions are:**

1. Can I do the second step (request CRAs to validate or delete) online? Can I send the request to the CRAs only and skip the CAs altogether?
2. In the linked post, [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/nlriu4/comment/gzkx7re/) by u/mickvain states, ""after the initial 30 day period they are under no obligation to respond  to debt validation requests in order to keep reporting the to them CRA’s."" Does it mean that there's no point or utility to request validation in my case?
3. If the CAs or CRAs provide validations or don't delete the collections, will it have any adverse outcome for me, e.g., the collections being in my CR for a longer period, instead of being removed this year?
4. How do I delete these records if they provide validations of the debt? As I was never served the debt notice, is there another way to dispute these?
5. \[Added on 03.08.2022\] I notice that the collections are updated periodically on my Credit Report (latest update on Dec 2021) and my credit score suffers after the update. Could someone please explain what these updates are, and until when this will happen? If I ask dispute these collections directly with the CRAs, will it lead to some kind of updates as well?
6. \[Added on 03.08.2022\] Just found that there's something called ""**Early Exclusion**."" Can I benefit from this? I called Trans Union today but the rep and the rep's supervisor both said they can only dispute, they don't know anything about early exclusion. Could someone please elaborate how it works?

Waiting to know if it will reflect once again for an ongoing auto loan.,2,t9c9y7,CRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRedit/comments/t9c9y7/disputed_and_removed_late_payment_upon_blocking/,1,"Late payments are generally one’s worst enemy when it comes to credit scores , especially if they are within one year. Even after you close out a loan, these late payment records stay up to 7 years and they still hurt your credit scores a lot. One can expect 20 to 30+ points increase upon making a late payment disappear off their credit report, if it is recent. 

After disputing directly with the creditors by sending CEO ‘goodwill’ emails , snail mails with proper documentation on why I missed out on a single 30-day late payment (medical and negligence both), and apologizing profusely - I ended up only being frustrated having wasted a ton of time. All my efforts yielded standard responses and no gain as goodwill letters / Equifax / TransUnion / Experian disputes don’t really work if the late payment is a valid one. 

Finally, before giving up altogether, I resorted to one another method that the YouTube tutorials and credit repair agencies suggested, but don’t explain a lot - because this is how they probably make money. I had also engaged LexingtonLaw and it has been an absolute waste of $40 past two months (with discounts) under their cheapest plan, and I plan on discontinuing them anyways. I went ahead and blocked / froze / opted-out ( google search name followed by opt-out ) SageStream , LexisNexis , ARS (Advanced Resolution Services) , Innovis , and CoreLogic third party credit bureaus finally after navigating through their web portals. I also had to call in using phone to block one of them and had to manually e-fill a PDF for blocking another one. Overall, I religiously provided all my addresses and names while opting out (can get this exhaustive list from a annualcreditreport.com) and this process took about 20 days. I would suggest to wait out a month before getting ready to dispute once again since the opt out process can take sometime to kick in. These companies will mail you the intent to opt out and I recommend saving all these paper mails so that you can unblock later on.

Finally, I used Equifax and TransUnion dispute centers to file disputes with a statement recognizing my CEO email and a boilerplate reply from their executive team promising to resolve this (ultimately they did state it is accurate , FCRA guidelines , but you leave out that part). To my surprise , after about 2 weeks , my Equifax has deleted this single 30-day late payment which was 3 years old. This loan was closed out long back by me, but this method certainly works. The remark I got was “ there has been a temporary freeze on my credit file “ , and since they could not verify the dispute , the late payment is now gone ( along with it also disappeared my payment history but I don’t care ). Experian is a little tricky and you can file a dispute online ( Do not recommended calling them and filing the dispute ) by using Experian.com/upload - but you would have to indicate everything manually as an attachment. I plan on doing this on another 30-day late payment from last year (This is an ongoing auto loan and I shifted apartments between the time the loan started and first payment was due, mail forwarding didn’t happen and I missed out on getting my loan number and online access set up on time though i had communicated at the start of my car purchase that I was going to move apartments). I am still curious whether all of the reporting will happen once again after the dispute goes through successful and whether my late payment from last year would reappear in my credit report or not. I am yet to find that out, but my journey of 3 months did end up being fruitful and stressful - all for missing two 30-day payments! Never miss payments! Collections affect your report more , but also can be removed easily. Late payments are really tough to fight against !!",1646728058.0

Background: going through a separation and soon to be divorced. 26 Male in Michigan. We had a house that we owned together and just sold. So thanks to the market we more than doubled our money. After splitting our equity I paid off all of my old credit card debt, my car, and put a down payment on my own place. It was roughly 15,000 in debt. I Bought a trailer in a mobile home park near my work. My credit was below a 600 to start. After just doing that it shot up to around 650 according to credit Karma, but it seems to be plateauing. I’m assuming/hoping my mortgage on my trailer will still count the same and eventually raise my score. 

Here’s the bad. I had one missed CC payment on my personal credit card from over a year ago or so, possibly even 2 years now I can’t remember exactly. And before my wife left I co-signed on a Credit Card with her (not knowing this was gonna happen of course) that she failed to make at least a few payments on once she was on her own and didn’t have my income to support her. I know that one is paid off now because I asked her to pay it off and close it. Which she proved to me she did but I’m sure the negative remarks are still there for both of us. 

So now I’m wondering what is the best way to improve my credit score from here. My goal is to finance a new motorcycle by this Summer after the divorce is finalized to try and distract myself (she left me). Call it my “Divorced Life Crisis” lol. I more than have the monthly income to support it, especially after downsizing my home payment and no longer having a car payment. Honestly this divorce was the best thing to happen to me financially so I’m trying to be glass half full. Even if she comes after me for child support (which she claimed she won’t but we’ll see) she wouldn’t get much. She works full time and doesn’t make that much less than I do hourly rate wise. And we do 50/50 week on week off with my daughter. We were also married less than 3 years. Still get along decent for what it’s worth as well. 

Is it best to use my current credit card (Navy Federal Credit Union Cashback card) in small amounts and pay it off shortly after? Maybe Apply for a different one? I have had this card for about 4 years now. 

Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Thanks all!",1646693164.0

I think the reason I was able to get to 850 was because of 2 factors that I wasn't doing before until recently:

1. I added a ""diversity"" of debt. When my score was hovering around 800 I had student loan and credit card debt but that was it. In the last year I got a car loan and a house mortgage. I think that diversifying my loan debt gave me a bump.
2. For years I carried zero credit card debt. However in the last few months I made it a point to make small purchases on credit cards periodically, no more than 5% of my total credit limit. Actually using my credit cards instead of just carrying a zero balance forever helped.

After a divorce in 2020, ex and I still have a a joint credit card with USAA.  Limit is $14,000.  Current balance is zero.  Ex and I agreed to leave that card open with zero balance to help both of our credit scores while she refinanced the former marital residence, and I bought a house.

Refi is done, so I'm looking to buy soon. My question is, what would be the impact to my scores of closing the joint account now?  I'd have a lower limit and thinner file, I know, but how much might that move the needle?

I trust my ex not to max out the USAA card, but closing sooner rather than later eliminates that risk entirely.  Also, I plan to use the Citi card to churn a few hundred dollars each month, but not carry a balance.  Even with a $16k aggregate limit I'll keep utilization below 5%.

No student loans. 1 discover cash back card with a $1250 limit (current at $1500 balance on that but will be paid off by next week). My income now is not a problem. I make $190k/year before taxes and spend about $2000/month in expenses like rent and food/bills, so I aim to have all 12k debt paid off by June 1 this year. How soon can I get my credit back up to where it was as long as I pay off all debt? Lease is up in October so looking to purchase by then. 
Here’s a summary of my debt:
- AMEX card: charged off. $4k. 12 late payments (do they remove late payments if you pay the account in full?)
- Kohl’s charge: $3k. 4 late payments. charged off. 
- Comenity: $4k. 8 late payments. charged off. 
- 1 account in collections from credit one. $1k. haven’t checked if they can pay to delete yet. 

What’s the best/worst case scenario for my credit score and mortgage approval? By the time I apply for a loan in late Sept. I will have $0 in debt and approx $50k saved for a down payment. I tried looking through this sub but the only similar cases I can find is when others have paid down debt gradually, not all at once. 

Thank you!

Editing to add:
I have $0 in student loans, paid that off. It seems like the only thing holding me back is the debt & late payments. Kohls and comenity will not pay to delete, but AMEX might, I haven’t had the chance to speak with them because the hold times were too long. What looks best on my loan application? Settling the debts or paying in full? Kohls and comenity are able to settle for about 55% of the original debt. I’m totally OK with paying in full, but if i can save a few thousand by settling with no repercussions then I’d prefer that.",1646575660.0

Within a week or so after accepting the Cap One secured card I went with the Chime Credit Builder card. I let those age a bit for roughly 2-3 months.

Only my Equifax background shows the credit limit witch is $3000.00. Kick off gave me $500.00 in ""bs"" non-usable credit. Along with that it charges you $24.00 to be prayed back over the course of a year. So that's $2.00 a month. The Petal card is backed by Web-Bank and takes other factors into account other than just a score. Such as income and cash on hand. Pedal gave me a $500.00 limit as well as 1% back on all purchases.

The $20k is mostly high-interest credit cards. No good reason other than an overly casual approach to my finances. So I'm finally getting serious with myself. I have a snowball/avalance calculator showing that I will pay this off by June or July 2023. But I'd like to move cash over to pay down this debt more quickly.

I owe: about $17K to high-interest credit cards (the 20% variety)

I have a monthly cash flow of about $8000. House and car are owned free and clear.

I also have about $5000 in an emergency fund, another $5000 in low-interest accounts, and about $1500 in reserves in my bill payer account.  I also have about $26K in equities in a non-retirement account. Should I deplete these funds to pay down the debt? Do a balance transfer into the zero interest card?

Naturally, we were concerned about the difference and pulled all 3 of her reports from annual credit check. We found that the only credit card she had was not reporting to Equifax or Transunion. She had the card for over 6 years, so those two reports were missing 6 years of credit history on a revolving account. Thankfully her auto loan was being reported to all 3. 

What steps does she have to take to get that credit card’s history reported to the other 2 bureaus? I told her to go down to the credit union first, but from what I understand lawfully they don’t need to report to the other’s correct? Is it common among smaller credit unions to only report to one bureau? She’s missing an awful lot of credit history on two of her reports now. The car loan is fairly recent. 

In the meantime, since she wanted a little cash back on a card as her current card offers no rewards I had her apply for an Amex card. They pull Experian so I figured she’d be approved there.

Best tips: be human to the collection agencies, they’re just employees and unless they’re jerks to you there’s no reason to treat them like dirt. Be clear about how much you’re willing to spend. Worst they can say is no. Never acknowledge debt or make a promise to pay it back fully. Use terms like “can we negotiate what I’d have to pay **to get this off my report**” and not “to pay what I owe”.  
  
My app favorites: Credit Karma for alerts, Experian for free FICO 8, Credit.com for free Experian VS 3.0. Personally I paid for the MyFICO but it’s expensive.

I've heard one of the best ways to build a good score is to get one of those low budget credit cards and just use that for regular purchases, keeping it topped up?

My husband has two outstanding debts from his previous marriage totaling $15k that have been charged off but still with original creditor. We paid off most of my outstanding debt with just one left that's $3k that's also charged off and still with the original creditor.

We went through a rough patch and settled on all of our credit cards. We have a car loan listed as current under both of our names and student loans listed as current under my husband's name.

Our goal is to buy a house, but we need to lower our debt to income ratio and raise our middle credit scores to at least a 620 to go FHA/Conventional or 640 to go USDA.

Yesterday, we were advised by a lender that we shouldn't pay a lump sum on the charged off credit cards (DOFD: 6/2018) because it'll tank our credit scores, but we should make payments on them. 

Today, the same lender told us we shouldn't settle the cards at all because they're charge offs.

We ran a simulator on MyFICO, and it showed that if we paid the debt off, my husband's scores should go up tremendously.

Any suggestions on what to do? We plan to pay everything off when we get our tax returns, but if that'll cause our scores to drop even more, maybe we can put that towards a down payment?

I can pay it but it all feels insane. But when I go lower in price I'm looking at cars with 80-90k 100k miles and God knows what other problems. For 20 to 30k...

Should I take the personal loan first pay off my credit cards and try to see if I can get my credit up a bit more in the next 2 or 3 months before my car does for good?Will the Microchip shortage be over?

Went back to school full-time in 2015 to complete my undergrad degree but I wasn’t working at the time, so ended up doing a “pro-active” repossession if you will. Advised Cap1 I was a full-time student with no income and I could no longer pay my car note.

Last payment posted was in September 2016. As of March 2022 my account has never gone to collections, but occasionally Cap1 will send me a letter or email encouraging me to settle the account for significantly less that what’s owed or pay it in full.

Does it makes sense to pay it off either in full or partially or wait for it to fall off my report next year? Details below:

• Original loan amount: $12,975
• Account opened: August 2014
• Amount paid to date: $6,839
• Amount owed: $6,136
• Account closed: September 2016
• Last payment date: October 2016

Partial payment amount and credit report stipulations:

Pay $771.97 (12.58%) of original balance
•Remaining balance forgiven
•Inform credit bureaus “paid in full for less than the full balance”
•Future lenders may see my prior charge off and that I paid less than what I owed.

Full payment and credit report stipulations:

Pay $6,136.78 (original balance)
•Account will be paid in full, with nothing more to owe.
•Inform the credit bureaus account is “paid in full”
•Future lenders may see my prior charge off and that I paid my account in full.

Cap1 has also given me the option to break down each payment for up to 36 months.

Additional details: I have 2 credit cards with Cap1 as well as a checking and savings account for around 3 years now. All my accounts have been in good standing which is why I believe they haven’t sent the auto loan to collections.

Anyways, I'm wondering if there are any options for me to hopefully recover my credit. My first instinct is to dispute the collection on the grounds that I thought someone from the vendor took the equipment back. 


However, I'm also wondering if there are any requirements for the collections agency or vendor to inform me of the debt; I reviewed my records and found no emails, phonecards, or physical letters of yhe debt from either the collections agency or yhe vendor. Are there any requirements on them to send proper notification, that I could utilize to reduce the impact to my credit, or possibly get the collections record deleted?

This isn't really a question of paying off the collection; if the vendor insists they did not receive the equipment back, I'm okay with paying off the balance. This is more of a concern of if I can get the collection removed from my credit, as I really do not want to have it on there for seven years.",1646335932.0

So instead I started paying my university directly using a one-time payment portal over the next few years and stopped hearing from the collections agency. Long story short by 2020 I had roughly a remaining balance of $560 left to pay according to my student account. I no longer have access to my student account so I can not confirm the exact total, but I do have some bank statements that show that I have at least paid the university $1800. At one point, I did change banks, so I can't back track any more payments made. Back in 2021 I did reach out to my university regarding the remaining balance via email and they did acknowledge that I had been making payment to them directly but that they could not disclose my remaining balance as I have to pay whatever fee they paid to send me to collections on top of what I had left to pay.

My dilemma is that I did pay my university back the majority of the balance, so why is the collections agency asking for $3035.50? What about the roughly $2400 that I paid over the years to the school? Should I contact my university's finance department about this situation or the collections agency.

* **For a conventional home loan, it’s important to have a credit score of at least 620.** Anything lower may deliver a higher interest rate. Conventional loans have lots of other qualifications, following Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines.
* **FHA loans** are more flexible about credit scores and other qualifications. Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, **you'll need a minimum credit score of 580** and a down payment as low as 3.5%.
* **VA loans** are available to members of the military and their spouses. Insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs, many lenders require a score **between 580 and 620** and often don’t require a down payment.
* **USDA loans** are backed by the Department of Agriculture. Like VA loans, a down payment isn’t always required, although most lenders require a FICO score of **640 or higher.**
* **Jumbo loans** are typically larger than conventional loans and often look for a credit score of **at least 700** as well as a large down payment.

If you have a low credit score and are thinking about a mortgage, start working on your credit history.

1. ***Pay bills on time -*** One of the biggest factors in your credit score is your on-time payment history. Lenders want proof that you can make payments as promised and handle your debts responsibly. Your payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score.
2. ***Maintain low credit utilization*** \- Most experts recommend using no more than 30% of your available credit, across all your cards. Your credit utilization is another big factor credit bureaus use to determine your score.
3. ***Track your credit reports*** \- Check your credit reports regularly. If there are errors, file a dispute with the credit bureau and your card issuer.
4. ***Pay off debts*** \- If you're carrying debt, pay down your credit card balances. Mortgage lenders will review your debt-to-income ratio to determine if you can afford a home loan.
5. ***Keep credit open*** \- When you keep older credit cards open and active, you’re building a strong credit history (as well as lowering your credit utilization).",1646162237.0

Also the store cards are issued by real banks, but they are known to be easier to get.. and  tend to have low limits.

Plus these ones that I don’t use are potentially taking up credit that I could get from better cards / and institutions that would in turn be thought of more highly than These other ones.. also the credit age is low on them.. but so is pretty much all of my credit age..  any thoughts?

I got arrested back in 2019. Back then I had around 800 credit score but I had credit card bills and loans. Monthly regular payments, was paying on time for years.

The problem was nothing was set on autopay, so while I was locked up I still had outstanding unpaid balance sitting in my accounts. When I got out in 2021, all my accounts were closed and my current credit score is around 560.

Is it even possible to get over 700 while you have a student loan? It seems it would kill the utilization. And the day I go apply for a loan the DTI will be through the roof thank to the student loan.
