Core business performance
Canadian Retail and Business Banking reported net income of $719 million for the third quarter, up $53 million or 8% from the third quarter a year ago.
Excluding items of note, adjusted net income(1) was $720 million, up $53 million or 8% from the third quarter a year ago. Solid volume growth and higher fees
were partially offset by narrower spreads and higher spending on strategic initiatives.
Canadian Retail and Business Banking continued to make progress against our objectives of leadership in profitable revenue growth and client experience.
During the third quarter of 2017:
 CIBC earned the highest overall score for the fourth consecutive year for online banking functionality among the five largest retail banks in Canada in
Forrester Research Inc.s 2017 Canadian Online Banking Benchmark report;
 CIBC ranked #1 among the six largest retail banks in Canada for the third consecutive year in the Investment Executive 2017 Report Card on Banks; and
 CIBC was the first Canadian financial institution to offer all three leading mobile wallets and the first major Canadian bank to introduce free mobile credit
scores for clients.
Canadian Wealth Management reported net income of $136 million for the third quarter, down $370 million or 73% from the third quarter a year ago,
which included a gain of $383 million, net of transaction costs, on the sale of our minority investment in American Century Investments. Excluding this gain and
other items of note, adjusted net income(1) was $136 million, up $12 million or 10% from the third quarter a year ago, driven by higher revenue, partially offset
by higher expenses. The higher revenue was driven primarily by growth in fee-based client assets and higher commission revenue from debt and equity issuance
activity.
During the third quarter of 2017, Canadian Wealth Management continued to make progress against our objectives of enhancing client experience,
driving asset growth, and simplifying our business platform:
 We introduced a suite of new, lower-cost CIBC Passive Portfolios to improve value and accessibility for Canadian investors;

 We launched the CIBC Active Global Currency Pool for institutional investors, leveraging our 20-year track record of managing active currency strategies
for institutional investors.

quarter a year ago. Excluding items of note, adjusted net income(1) was $44 million, up $19 million or 76% from the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to
the inclusion of the results of The PrivateBank in the current quarter.
During the third quarter of 2017, U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management:
 Completed the acquisition of The PrivateBank, a Chicago-based commercial bank with personal banking and wealth management capabilities;
 Entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Geneva Advisors, a private wealth management firm headquartered in Chicago. This transaction is expected

 Received first time deposit ratings from Moodys and Fitch for The PrivateBank, expanding our capabilities to serve new and existing commercial clients.
Capital Markets reported net income of $252 million for the third quarter, down $29 million or 10% from the third quarter a year ago. Excluding items of
note, adjusted net income(1) was $252 million, down $38 million or 13%, primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower expenses. Revenue was lower
primarily due to lower equity derivatives and interest rate trading and lower equity underwriting revenue, partially offset by higher corporate banking revenue
and investment portfolio gains.
